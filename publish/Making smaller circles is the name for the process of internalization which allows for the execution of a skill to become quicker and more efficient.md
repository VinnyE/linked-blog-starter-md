### The Principle of "Making Smaller Circles"
Over time, an artist's movements can begin to shrink in physical size, but increase in potency. This process of internalization, called 'Making Smaller Circles,' allows for the execution of the skill to become quicker and more efficient. Just as a musician knows how a note should feel rather than relying solely on auditory feedback, so too should we internalize the sensations associated with performing a skill correctly.
