Herbert Simon's concept of 'satisficing' describes the process of making the best possible choice with our limited knowledge and understanding. Rather than seeking the non-existent 'perfect' option, we should focus on making a decision based on the best information available to us. The fear of 'settling' for an inferior option can stall our decision-making process, but it's crucial to understand that 'inferior' or 'superior' are often subjective labels we assign based on our perceptions.
