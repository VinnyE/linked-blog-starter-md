The ability to maintain a clear, present mindset, especially under pressure, significantly distinguishes the excellent from the average across all disciplines. The implications of this principle are vividly apparent in competitive situations, where a composed contender often triumphs over an opponent grappling with internal struggles. However, this principle also applies, perhaps even more importantly, to solitary endeavors like writing, learning, or any form of creative work. When external reinforcement is lacking, self-monitoring becomes crucial, and our quality of presence becomes the best measure of our performance.

To truly excel and enjoy the richness of our pursuits, we cannot be merely 'going through the motions.' We must engage deeply and meaningfully with the task at hand, treating every moment as if everything is at stake. This attitude of full, fluid presence should become second nature, elevating our everyday life, art, and learning experiences to a level of richness that is continuously surprising and delightful.

Those who succeed do so by unlocking the creative potential inherent in each moment. They approach their daily learning process with the same level of focus others reserve for pivotal moments. They understand that in truth, every moment is a pivotal moment. The more present we are in our daily activities, the more prepared we are to excel in high-pressure situations. If we aspire to achieve excellence, we must cultivate a lifestyle that continuously reinforces this principle of presence, making it as natural and as necessary as breathing.

To deepen our life experience, we need to pay attention to its finest details and nuances, delving beyond the surface. This means fully committing to every task and responsibility, large or small. A key to this lies in maintaining a keen, yet relaxed focus that allows us to self-motivate and self-monitor, particularly in the absence of external validation. Only by doing so can we truly maximize the potential of each moment, ensuring that we are consistently present, engaged, and primed for excellence.

> In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is much of what separates the best from the mediocre. In competition, the dynamic is often painfully transparent. If one player is serenely present while the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear. The prey is no longer objective, makes compounding mistakes, and the predator moves in for the kill. While more subtle, this issue is perhaps even more critical in solitary pursuits such as writing, painting, scholarly thinking, or learning. In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often the best gauge. We cannot expect to touch excellence if “going through the motions” is the norm of our lives. On the other hand, if deep, fluid presence becomes second nature, then life, art, and learning take on a richness that will continually surprise and delight. Those who excel are those who maximize each moment’s creative potential—for these masters of living, presence to the day-to-day learning process is akin to that purity of focus others dream of achieving in rare climactic moments when everything is on the line. The secret is that everything is always on the line. The more present we are at practice, the more present we will be in competition, in the boardroom, at the exam, the operating table, the big stage. If we have any hope of attaining excellence, let alone of showing what we’ve got under pressure, we have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement. Presence must be like breathing.

> We enrich our experience of life by attuning ourselves to its subtlest aspects and delving deeply into its details. One cannot excel at a pursuit nor experience its delights by bringing a skimming approach to it or handling related responsibilities in a shallow manner. To excel, our perspective must be that everything is on the line at all times and we must maximize each and every moment’s potential. To do so demands that we be fully present and engaged at every stage of our relationships, studies, and work—not just in the moments we think are critical but also in the moments leading up to them. And when there is no one to look in; no one to give feedback or cheer us on, a keen but relaxed focus will enable us to motivate and monitor ourselves. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/peak-performance/the-power-of-presence/
