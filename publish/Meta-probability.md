Meta-probability has to do with [[Asymmetries]] and [[Probabalistic thinking]]. Simply it means the probability that your probabilities are any good. It is probability about a probability. For example, when forecasting the likelihood of an event occurring, you might estimate a 70% chance of it happening. The meta-probability would be your confidence in the accuracy of that 70% estimate.

1. [[Bayesian thinking]] - Meta-probability can be incorporated into this framework by considering the confidence in the initial probability estimate and updating it based on new information.
2. [[Second-order thinking]] - In the context of meta-probability, second-order thinking could involve considering how confidence in a probability estimate might influence decision-making.
3. [[remote-blog/publish/Circle of competence|Circle of competence]] - When assigning a meta-probability to a probability estimate, it helps to consider whether the estimate falls within our circle of competence or whether we might be overestimating our understanding of the situation.

> This massively misunderstood concept has to do with asymmetries. If you look at nicely polished stock pitches made by professional investors, nearly every time an idea is presented, the investor looks their audience in the eye and states they think they’re going to achieve a rate of return of 20% to 40% per annum, if not higher. Yet exceedingly few of them ever attain that mark, and it’s not because they don’t have any winners. It’s because they get so many so wrong. They consistently overestimate their confidence in their probabilistic estimates.
