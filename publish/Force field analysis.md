Force field analysis is a decision-making technique developed by Kurt Lewin, a social psychologist, in the 1940s. This technique is used to evaluate the forces that are driving and resisting a proposed change.

In a force field analysis, the "field" is the total situation or environment involving the change. The "forces" are the various factors, conditions, or influences that promote (driving forces) or hinder (restraining forces) the change. This technique is an application of [[Inversion]] to bring about desired changes.

The steps involved in a force field analysis include:

1.  **Identify the problem or change:** Define the current situation and the desired situation or goal.
2.  **List the driving forces:** Identify all forces or factors that support or facilitate the change. These could include resources, attitudes, stakeholders, or other elements that would help achieve the desired goal.
3.  **List the restraining forces:** Identify all forces or factors that oppose or resist the change. These could be obstacles, attitudes, people, lack of resources, or any other elements that could prevent or slow down the achievement of the desired goal.
4.  **Evaluate and analyze the forces:** Assign scores to each force based on its strength or influence. This will help in visualizing the balance between the two sets of forces.
5.  **Develop a strategy:** Based on the analysis, develop a plan of action to strengthen the driving forces and weaken or remove the restraining forces. This could involve increasing resources, changing attitudes, managing stakeholders, or addressing other key factors identified in the analysis.

Force field analysis is widely used in organizational and business settings for strategic planning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It helps teams visualize the complexity of a situation, understand various influences, and identify the most effective actions to facilitate change.

>  from psychologist Kurt Lewin. In the 1930s he came up with the idea of force field analysis, which essentially recognizes that in any situation where change is desired, successful management of that change requires applied inversion. Here is a brief explanation of his process: Identify the problem Define your objective Identify the forces that support change towards your objective Identify the forces that impede change towards the objective Strategize a solution! This may involve both augmenting or adding to the forces in step 3, and reducing or eliminating the forces in step 4.
