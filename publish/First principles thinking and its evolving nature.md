First principles are foundational concepts that guide our understanding and decision-making in various situations. However, they do not represent an unchanging set of truths. As our knowledge evolves, so do our first principles (see: [[Continuously update maps and models for accuracy]]). They serve as the boundaries within which we operate, and by breaking down complex ideas into their core principles (see: [[Simple ideas are valuable because they can help us prevent complex problems]]), we can challenge traditional assumptions and generate novel solutions.

First principles thinking is another sort of mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) we can leverage to [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]] . How can we leverage first principles? We can use [[Techniques for uncovering first principles]].

> First principles do not provide a checklist of things that will always be true; our knowledge of first principles changes as we understand more. They are the foundation on which we must build, and thus will be different in every situation, but the more we know, the more we can challenge. For example, if we are considering how to improve the energy efficiency of a refrigerator, then the laws of thermodynamics can be taken as first principles. However, a theoretical chemist or physicist might want to explore entropy, and thus further break the second law into its underlying principles and the assumptions that were made because of them. First principles are the boundaries that we have to work within in any given situation
