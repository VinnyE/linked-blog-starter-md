### The Illusion of Simplicity
As the artist (say a martial artist) continues to refine their skill, the movements become almost invisible to the untrained eye.

This highlights how true mastery can often look deceptively simple, much like the knockout punches thrown by boxing legends like Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali.
