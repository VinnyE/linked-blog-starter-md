Socratic questioning is a disciplined and systematic approach to uncovering [[First principles thinking and its evolving nature]], separating reliable knowledge from ignorance, and identifying underlying assumptions. Unlike ordinary discussions, Socratic questioning aims to extract foundational concepts through a rigorous process. 

This method involves a series of steps: clarifying thoughts and the origins of ideas; challenging assumptions; seeking evidence to support claims; considering alternative viewpoints; examining the consequences and implications of one's beliefs; and finally, revisiting the initial questions to evaluate their validity and draw conclusions. 

What's the benefit? by employing Socratic questioning, we can avoid relying on instinct or emotional reactions, fostering more robust and enduring understanding, and so in this way we slowly [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]].

> Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This is a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and ordinary discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. Socratic questioning generally follows this process: 
> 
> 1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
> 2. Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) 
> 3. Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
> 4. Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
> 5. Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
> 6. Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
> 
> Socratic questioning stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts.
