Success and failure in different fields can be heavily influenced by an individual's theory of intelligence. [[Entity theorists]] might crumble under the pressure of maintaining perfection, which could impede their performance under challenging situations. Conversely, learning theorists, who value the lessons learned from the pursuit of excellence and perceive failure as an opportunity to grow, are more resilient and adaptable, and thus, likely to be happier in their journey.
