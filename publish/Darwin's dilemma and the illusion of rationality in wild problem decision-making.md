title: "Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making"

In 1838, Charles Darwin found himself grappling with a significant life decision – whether to marry and potentially have children. To address this dilemma, he employed a seemingly rational approach of listing the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with each choice. Darwin tried to envisage the everyday joys and challenges of married life, and how those would feel to him in the future.

This approach epitomizes the conventional definition of rationality, where one attempts to forecast the expected well-being resulting from each potential decision, and then opts for the choice promising the highest projected well-being.

The mathematical term 'scalar' is used to represent numerical values that describe physical concepts, like area. Its etymology traces back to the Latin word 'scala', which means ladder or scale, hinting at something that aids in climbing or rising. Similarly, Benjamin Franklin's advice to Joseph Priestley - to compare and balance the pros and cons - suggests the use of a 'scale' to measure and evaluate options against each other.

However, this method of condensing a complex set of information into a single number, or a scalar, comes with inherent limitations. Although scalars offer clean, precise values, they often oversimplify the intricacies of reality. The conversion process to a scalar might involve overlooking certain nuances or 'cutting corners', thereby compromising the accuracy of the scalar as a representation of a complex issue.

In our quest for certainty and simplicity, we tend to lean towards formulas or calculations that can seemingly strip away ambiguity. While the simplicity of formulas is appealing, it's also problematic because life, with all its intricacies and unpredictability, is anything but simple.

When it comes to decision-making, the use of scalars creates an illusion that we can make reliable comparisons and optimal choices based on these numerical representations. However, this perceived rationality of employing a cost-benefit analysis for making decisions in the face of complex, 'wild' problems, can often be misleading. It suggests a level of certainty and control that may not exist, overlooking the multifaceted nature of real-world problems and the inherent unpredictability of future outcomes.

> In 1838, Charles Darwin faced a wild problem. Nearing his thirtieth birthday, Darwin was trying to decide whether to marry—with the likelihood that children would be part of the package. Darwin made a list of the pluses and minuses related to the decision.

> On the one side he tried to imagine what it would be like to be married. On the other side he tried to imagine what it would be like not to marry. Darwin was trying to imagine the daily pluses and minuses of married life and how those pluses and minuses would feel when he experienced them in the future.

> This would seem to be the essence of rationality. Make your best estimate of your expected well-being from one decision versus another. Choose the one with the highest expected well-being.

> The mathematical name for a number that describes physical concepts like area is scalar. Its origin is the Latin word for ladder, “scala”—something that helps you to climb. It’s the same Latin word for scale—either a noun, to name things that help you measure, or a verb, as in to scale the highest peaks, to rise.

> Benjamin Franklin’s advice to Priestley is essentially the same thing. By looking for combinations of pros and cons that are roughly equal, he’s implying there’s a scale that allows the pros and cons to be measured in some approximate way and assessed versus each other.

> A matrix is messy. Its lessons are opaque. A scalar is clean and precise. The precision makes scalars seductive. But the usefulness and accuracy of a scalar depends on how many corners have to be cut to turn a complex set of information into a single number.

> We are always searching for a formula, a calculation that will remove the uncertainty. Formulas are simple. That’s a feature, but also a bug. Life is complicated.

> When it comes to decision-making, scalars—raw numbers like the index constructed for Alice and Bob—allow us to imagine we can make reliable comparisons, and that in turn encourages us to imagine it is possible to look into the future and make the best decision among the choices facing us.

> But the rationality of a cost-benefit list of expected well-being from the decisions we make in the face of wild problems is actually an illusion.
