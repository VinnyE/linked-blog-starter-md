title: "Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making"

Charles Darwin, facing the life-altering decision of whether to marry and have children, weighed the pros and cons of his options. On the surface, it seemed like a logical approach, converting complex emotions and potential futures into digestible numbers, like stepping stones on a scale or a ladder. However, trying to simplify life's complexities into a neat formula can often mislead us. In our search for certainty, we may be lured by the simplicity of numbers or 'scalars' that promise a clear path. But these measurements, as appealing as they are, can often be a mirage in the face of life's wild problems, where the best choice isn't always clear or quantifiable.

### Other thoughts
Effective decision making often requires more than just a scalar representation of the problem. We need a diverse set of tools and approaches which is why [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] is helpful:

Counter-intuitive: Uncertainty can also be a good thing for strategic problem solvers, as we're reminded in [[Bulletproof Problem Solving]]:

By developing [[The Antifragile Mindset]], we can actually benefit from unpredictability.

> Let’s summarize why a decision like Darwin’s in the face of a wild problem is so difficult: 
> - He can’t imagine his daily life as a husband and father, particularly the upside. So he can’t assess whether the expected costs outweigh the expected benefits. 
> - Even if he could imagine his daily life, he faces the vampire problem—how he experiences the costs and benefits once he’s married with children will change. 
> - And finally, there are aspects of being a husband and father that loom larger than just the everyday experiences of life, what I am calling flourishing. How should he take flourishing into account?

> In 1838, Charles Darwin faced a wild problem. Nearing his thirtieth birthday, Darwin was trying to decide whether to marry—with the likelihood that children would be part of the package. Darwin made a list of the pluses and minuses related to the decision.

> On the one side he tried to imagine what it would be like to be married. On the other side he tried to imagine what it would be like not to marry. Darwin was trying to imagine the daily pluses and minuses of married life and how those pluses and minuses would feel when he experienced them in the future.

> This would seem to be the essence of rationality. Make your best estimate of your expected well-being from one decision versus another. Choose the one with the highest expected well-being.

> The mathematical name for a number that describes physical concepts like area is scalar. Its origin is the Latin word for ladder, “scala”—something that helps you to climb. It’s the same Latin word for scale—either a noun, to name things that help you measure, or a verb, as in to scale the highest peaks, to rise.

> Benjamin Franklin’s advice to Priestley is essentially the same thing. By looking for combinations of pros and cons that are roughly equal, he’s implying there’s a scale that allows the pros and cons to be measured in some approximate way and assessed versus each other.

> A matrix is messy. Its lessons are opaque. A scalar is clean and precise. The precision makes scalars seductive. But the usefulness and accuracy of a scalar depends on how many corners have to be cut to turn a complex set of information into a single number.

> We are always searching for a formula, a calculation that will remove the uncertainty. Formulas are simple. That’s a feature, but also a bug. Life is complicated.

> When it comes to decision-making, scalars—raw numbers like the index constructed for Alice and Bob—allow us to imagine we can make reliable comparisons, and that in turn encourages us to imagine it is possible to look into the future and make the best decision among the choices facing us.

> But the rationality of a cost-benefit list of expected well-being from the decisions we make in the face of wild problems is actually an illusion.
