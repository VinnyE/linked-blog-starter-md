Every good storyteller's aim should be to craft a vivid and unbroken movie in the listener's mind. This is achieved not by centering oneself or inserting unnecessary asides, but by continually providing a clear physical location in the narrative. As long as the audience can visualize the place where the action is happening, the cinematic experience is sustained, engaging the audience more deeply in the unfolding tale.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Power of Visualization in Storytelling
A storyteller's primary goal is to evoke a vivid and consistent mental movie in the minds of the listeners. The most compelling narratives are those that transport listeners into the heart of the action, painting a picture so vibrant and engrossing that they can practically see, feel, and touch the story's world.

### The Storyteller's Role and Focus
Great storytellers do not make themselves the stars of the show. Instead, they ensure that the story remains at the center. This means avoiding diversions such as unrelated jokes or unnecessary observations that might distract from the main narrative and thus break the audience's mental movie.

### Importance of Physical Location in a Story
One crucial technique for keeping the audience's mental movie running is always providing a physical location for each moment in the story. By clearly situating the action in a particular place, storytellers help listeners visualize the story more clearly, which enhances their engagement and enjoyment of the narrative.

> A great storyteller creates a movie in the minds of the audience. Whether your audience is a theater full of storytelling fans, a boardroom filled with potential clients, a classroom bursting with apathetic high-school students, or a group of friends around the dinner table, the goal of every storyteller should be to create a cinematic experience in the minds of every listener.
> 
> You may think this it's obvious, but if it were, storytellers would do this all the time. They would obsess about the idea of maintaining an unrelenting, uninterrupted movie in the minds of their listeners. But they don't. Often, instead of making the story the center of their performance, storytellers make themselves the center of the show. They crack jokes. Insert amusing or observational non sequiturs. Even worse, they open stories by pontificating and proselytizing. These are not the beginnings to stories. Stories are not supposed to start with thesis statements or overwrought aphorisms.
> 
> Listeners should be able to see the story in their mind’s eye at all times. At no point should the story become visually obscured or impossible to see. As the title of this chapter suggests, effective storytelling is cinema of the mind. In order to achieve this lofty goal, storytellers must do one thing, and happily for you, it’s exceedingly simple: Always provide a physical location for every moment of your story. That’s it. If the audience knows where you are at all times within your story, the movie is running in their minds. The film is cycling from reel to reel. If your audience can picture the location of the action at all times, you have created a movie in the mind of your listeners. Hopefully it’s a good one.
