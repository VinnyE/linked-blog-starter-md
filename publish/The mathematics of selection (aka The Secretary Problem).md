The story of Penelope, waiting for her husband Odysseus, while fending off 108 suitors, is analogous to the mathematical problem known as the secretary problem. This problem suggests a strategy of reviewing 37% of options (in Penelope's case, suitors/euler's #) without committing, and then selecting the next one that surpasses the best from the initial set. However, real life, especially love and partnership, is more complex than mathematical formulas.
