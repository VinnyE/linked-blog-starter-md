**Journey to mastery** 
Mastery in any discipline is a journey that begins with understanding the fundamentals. We must establish a robust foundation rooted in the principles of the discipline in question. As we progress, we expand and refine our knowledge, guided by our individual predispositions. The result is a network of deeply internalized and interconnected knowledge that stems from a personal locus point.
