title: "When faced with a decision, we should consider not just the immediate utility of our choices, but also how we may flourish"

In decision-making, while logical analysis of costs and benefits is necessary, it's not always the deciding factor. Sometimes, emotional reactions or personal preferences guide us more truthfully to what we desire. The conventional economist's view of life is akin to a day at an amusement park, deciding on experiences based on their expected pleasure. However, humans seek more than transient pleasures and avoidance of pain. We seek purpose, meaning, and a sense of belonging. The Greeks referred to this as eudaemonia, the state of flourishing in life. Flourishing encapsulates not just transient joys but also intangible elements such as virtue, purpose, and autonomy.

## Concept Breakdown

### Decision-Making: Logic vs Emotion
Decision-making is traditionally perceived as a rational process where you weigh the costs and benefits of your choices. But, surprisingly, emotions and personal preferences can sometimes guide us more accurately to what we truly desire. In other words, the decision-making process should account for both our rational evaluations and our emotional inclinations. This dual-faceted approach allows us to better discern our preferences, especially when logical analysis alone fails to provide a clear answer.

### Utilitarianism: Pleasure vs Pain
The utilitarian approach, put forward by Jeremy Bentham and widely used by economists, suggests humans are motivated by maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. This perspective sees life as a sort of amusement park, where we make choices to accumulate the greatest satisfaction given our constraints. However, this view often overlooks that humans are complex creatures who seek more than just transient pleasures and pain avoidance.

### Eudaemonia: Beyond Happiness
Humans care about more than transient joy or avoidance of pain. We desire purpose, meaning, and a sense of belonging. The ancient Greeks referred to this state as 'eudaemonia,' often inadequately translated as happiness or contentment. A better understanding is 'flourishing' - the experience of fully living life, embracing not just physical comforts, but also intangible elements like integrity, purpose, and autonomy. In this context, to flourish means to make the most of our circumstances and fulfill our human potential, thus leading a life that is more than just pleasant, but truly well-lived.

> Why was it so hard for him to calculate “expected utility”—which is economics jargon for his best guess of how he would feel about the outcome of choosing one path over another?

> In the same talk in which he recounted this story, Diaconis then says something even more shocking for a scholar of decision-making. He says that you should indeed make that list of costs and benefits, but not for the purpose of assessing them rationally. Rather, he argues, make the list in order to figure out what you’re “really after.” And by that he means where your heart lies.

> Diaconis then cites a poem, “A Psychological Tip,” by Piet Hein, a mathematician who was trained as a physicist and who liked to play what he called “mental ping-pong” with a fellow Dane, the great physicist Niels Bohr. Presumably, Hein was no slouch when it came to logic, reasoning, analytical thinking, and rationality. In the poem, Hein says that when you face a dilemma and can’t decide what to do, flip a penny in the air. Not as the way to make the decision, but as the way to discover “what you’re hoping,” in Hein’s words. While the penny is spinning, you’ll sense what you want the outcome to be. In other words—follow your impulsive reaction—your heart, maybe, or your gut, but not your mind.

> I think one of the values of those checklists is that they stimulate an emotional reaction that tells you what you really want—like tossing a coin, where you think you don’t have a preference, but when you see how the flip came out you feel disappointed, and that tells you that you really did have a preference.

> Normal human beings have trouble making decisions, and when we do, we often will come up with reasons that are merely an after-the-fact narrative—something we tell ourselves and others to justify what we’ve done or plan to do.

> But I don’t think they’re really saying that we should ignore reason. They’re saying that we care about something else besides what we experience or feel. They’re telling us there’s more than our future experiences at stake when we face a wild problem.

> A list of expected costs and benefits like Darwin’s that people use in decision-making is usually a summary of how their choices are going to make them feel. Will I be happier or less happy as a parent or a spouse? Will I like the new job better than the old one? If I have a job offer in Austin and one in Boston, which one will be more fun, more satisfying? Will the better seafood make up for the cold weather of Boston? Will Austin’s music scene outweigh the lack of fall foliage that is part of living in New England? These are all fundamentally utilitarian considerations. The utilitarian approach comes from Jeremy Bentham. In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, published in 1789, Bentham argued that human beings care about two things—pleasure and pain. If you have to make a decision, consider each choice and see which produces the most pleasure relative to pain. Bentham uses the word “utility” to summarize the good over and above the bad that results from an action or a policy. Utility is whatever pleases you, both physical pleasure and psychic pleasure. Bentham calls it “benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness.” On the surface, this makes sense. When we are faced with a decision, we care about making the best choice. Surely in making that choice, we would want to know how that choice is going to make us feel, not just physically but emotionally as well. Bentham’s approach became the backbone of how economists view what is called rational choice.

> In Bentham’s view and in the economist’s view of the human experience, life is something like a day at a giant amusement park where you have a fixed amount of money to spend on a finite number of rides. Because your income is finite, it isn’t feasible to have or do everything you desire. Rationally, you seek out the rides that you enjoy and avoid the ones you don’t. You ride some more than once as long as the pleasure you get from that extra time remains higher than the pleasure you might get from riding a different ride for the first time. The economist’s view of life is that your goal is to accumulate the greatest amount of satisfaction given the constraints of income and time.

> But I think Darwin and the other scientists and academics discussed in this chapter were uneasy facing their wild problems because they recognized that how we feel day to day or moment to moment—what I will call narrow utilitarianism—isn’t the only thing we care about.

> Human beings care about more than the day-to-day pleasures and pains of daily existence. We want purpose. We want meaning. We want to belong to something larger than ourselves. We aspire. We want to matter. These overarching sensations—the texture of our lives above and beyond what we call happiness or everyday pleasure—define who we are and how we see ourselves. These longings are at the heart of a life well lived.

>A life well lived is something more than a pleasant life. The Greeks called the condition of a life well lived eudaemonia. That word is sometimes translated as happiness or contentment. Those words fall short of capturing eudaemonia. “Flourishing” is a better translation and the word I will use here. There are two everyday senses of the word “flourish.” One is to be successful, usually in a material, financial sense. The second, the one I am using here, describes something organic and alive. Something flourishes by becoming something beautiful and worthy of admiration. We human beings flourish by taking our circumstances and making the most of them in fulfilling our human potential. To flourish as a human being is to live life fully. That means more than simply accumulating pleasures and avoiding pain. Flourishing includes living and acting with integrity, virtue, purpose, meaning, dignity, and autonomy—aspects of life that are not just difficult to quantify but that you might put front and center, regardless of the cost.
