[[Karl Popper]] emphasized the importance of falsifiability in determining the validity of a scientific theory. According to Popper, a theory can only be considered a part of empirical science if it can be proven wrong under specific conditions. This concept of falsifiability not only adds an element of risk to a theory, but also ensures its testability. If a predicted effect fails to materialize, then the theory can be refuted, strengthening the scientific method. 

Falsifiability serves as a filter in evaluating the robustness of theories. If a theory cannot be tested and proven false, it is impossible to definitively prove its validity. Instead, one can only attempt to determine the probability of its accuracy. By applying the criterion of falsifiability, one can better distinguish between strong, testable theories and those that are weak or unverifiable.

For example, when it comes to [[Understanding trends and laws in human history]], we can apply the criterion of falsifiability to historical analysis to ensure that conclusions are based on robust theories that are open to verification and scrutiny, rather than relying on untestable assumptions or extrapolations from trends that might not hold true in the futre. (Indeed Popper himself considered "historicism" a sort of pseudoscience.)

>  Karl Popper wrote “A theory is part of empirical science if and only if it conflicts with possible experiences and is therefore in principle falsifiable by experience.” The idea here is that if you can’t prove something wrong, you can’t really prove it right either. Thus, in Popper’s words, science requires testability: “If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.” This means a good theory must have an element of risk to it—namely, it has to risk being wrong. It must be able to be proven wrong under stated conditions

> Applying the filter of falsifiability helps us sort through which theories are more robust. If they can’t ever be proven false because we have no way of testing them, then the best we can do is try to determine their probability of being true.
