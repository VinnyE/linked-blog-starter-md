Relationships can be seen as either contracts, where the focus lies on personal benefit and score-keeping, or covenants, promises of shared experiences and journeys. Covenant relationships do not revolve around the question of getting one's "fair share," but rather, they emphasize shared experiences and the enjoyment of the ride. This perspective reframes sacrifices as satisfying habits and fosters a sense of loyalty and commitment.
