Life isn't a movie; it's a mix of both climactic and ordinary moments, and we must learn to savor both. To excel in high-pressure situations, we need to embrace waiting and simplicity, finding joy and richness in seemingly mundane experiences. This mindset creates a foundation for calm and alertness that can be triggered by a simple act, like taking a deep breath. Cultivating this state of mind makes everyday life more vivid and interconnected, allowing us to draw lessons from unexpected places—a leaf floating on the wind, a raindrop on the pavement. By identifying relaxing activities and creating a daily routine around them, we can establish a psychological trigger that leads us to a serene state, enhancing our performance during high-stress moments. So, to truly live and excel, we need to learn to love the wait, embrace the banal, and find our trigger for serenity.

## Concept Breakdown

### Embracing the Ordinary and the Wait
Life is not a series of climax moments, but a mixture of ordinary and exceptional times. A key to excelling during high-pressure situations is to not only be good at waiting but to love it, as it is life itself. We should find joy and richness in mundane moments and consider these as integral parts of our lives. The ability to value simplicity and the everyday lets us see life's hidden treasures and sets us on the path to success and happiness.

### Becoming Alert and Present
Developing a heightened state of awareness can make even the most common experiences feel extraordinary. This alertness lets us draw insights from unexpected sources—a floating leaf can teach us about going with the flow, while the sight of rainwater on the pavement can guide us on how to move smoothly. This enhanced perception intertwines all experiences, making each moment rich and unique.

### Developing a Serenity Trigger
We can create a psychological trigger to a serene state, which can be activated by a simple act like inhaling. This trigger helps us stay calm and alert, making it easier for us to handle high-pressure situations. By identifying activities that relax us and establishing a daily routine around these, we gradually internalize peace and calm. This routine then becomes a tool that can help us manage stress and enhance our performance in crucial moments.

### Applying the Trigger to Enhance Performance
Once we establish our serenity trigger, we can use it to manage high-stress situations effectively. This routine, condensed into a quick mental exercise, can provide the necessary calm and alertness for excelling in high-pressure moments, be it at work, school, or on the sports field. By regularly practicing our routine, we condition our minds to easily access this state of tranquility, giving us a solid foundation for success.

> One of the biggest roadblocks to releasing the tension during breaks of intense competition or in any other kind of challenging environment is the fear of whether we will be able to get it back. If getting focused is hit or miss, how can we give up our focus once we've finally got it? Conditioning to this insecurity begins young. As children, we might be told to "concentrate" by parents and teachers, and then be reprimanded if we look off into the stars. So the child learns to associate not focusing with being "bad". The result is that we concentrate with everything we've got until we can't withstand the pressure and have a meltdown. 

> In the martial arts world, this theme is also critical. The ability to wait for hours on end without exploding with tension or losing your edge is often what separates the top fighters before they step in the ring. Big tournaments involve a lot of downtime between matches. Some fighters keep themselves in a state of feverish alertness, always poised for action for fear their moment might come and they won't be ready. The more seasoned competitors relax, listen to headphones, and nap. They don't burn through their thanks before stepping on the mats.

> We don't live within a Hollywood screenplay where the crescendo erupts just when we want it to, and more often than not the climactic moments in our lives will follow many unclimactic, normal humdrum hours, days, weeks, or years. So how do we step up when our moment suddenly arises?
> 
> My answer is to redefine the question. Not only do we have to be good at waiting, we have to love it. Because waiting is not waiting, it is life. Too many of us live without fully engaging our minds, waiting for that moment when our real lives begin. Years pass in boredom, but that is okay because when our true love comes around, or we discover our real calling, we will begin. Of course the sad truth is that if we are not present to the moment, our true love could come and go and we wouldn’t even notice. And we will have become someone other than the you or I who would be able to embrace it. I believe an appreciation for simplicity, the everyday—the ability to dive deeply into the banal and discover life’s hidden richness—is where success, let alone happiness, emerges.

> Along these lines, when considering the issue of performance state, it is important to avoid focusing on those rare climactic moments of high-stakes competitive mayhem. If you get into a frenzy anticipating the moment that will decide your destiny, then when it arrives you will be overwrought with excitement and tension. To have success in crunch time, you need to integrate certain healthy patterns into your day-to-day life so that they are completely natural to you when the pressure is on. The real power of incremental growth comes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just keep on flowing when everything is on the line. 

> The point to this system of creating your own trigger is that a physiological connection is formed between the routine and the activity it precedes. Once the routine is internalized, it can be used before any activity and a similar state of mind will emerge. 

> Once a simple inhalation can trigger a state of tremendous alertness, our moment-to-moment awareness becomes blissful, like that of someone half-blind who puts on glasses for the first time. We see more as we walk down the street. The everyday becomes exquisitely beautiful. The notion of boredom becomes alien and absurd as we naturally soak in the lovely subtleties of the “banal.” All experiences become richly intertwined by our new vision, and then new connections begin to emerge. Rainwater streaming on a city pavement will teach a pianist how to flow. A leaf gliding easily with the wind will teach a controller how to let go. A housecat will teach me how to move. All moments become each moment.

> Every one of us has one or more activities or experiences that can lead us toward serenity. To create your own catalyst for peak performance (in other words, to "build your trigger"), first identify the one key activity that is _most_ relaxing for you. Then shape a simple routine comprising this and four to five additional personal relaxation methods _you know work for you_. Practice this routine daily for one month during down time to entrench a calm state of mind.
> 
> If you can only identify _a single_ activity that leads you to serenity, shape a routine of simple activities to practice before or after your known relaxation producer. After a month of practice, the soothing psychological benefits of your key activity will have suffused the routine; you will be able to use the routine to produce a state of calmness even when the key activity is not a part of it.
> 
> In both cases, the routine should be of your choosing but could, for instance, include a few minutes each of jogging, bathing, showering, walking, eating a snack, snuggling with a loved one, listening to a song, smelling something pleasing, or meditating. By the end of the month, you will have internalized a deeper sense of peace and reaped many physiological benefits. You can then use your routine as a prelude to a high-stress activity in order to enhance your psychological state and build a solid foundation for excelling—before critical moments at work, school and on the playing field. Gradually and incrementally condense the routine. In short order, you will be able to produce all its benefits by merely thinking about it or practicing a few seconds of it. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/peak-performance/build-your-trigger/
