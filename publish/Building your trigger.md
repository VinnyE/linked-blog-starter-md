The fear of losing focus often creates a psychological barrier that prevents us from fully disengaging during periods of relaxation or downtime, especially in high-stress or competitive environments. This fear is often rooted in our upbringing where focus and concentration are typically praised and rewarded while inattention is chastised. This can lead to a counterproductive state of constant tension and, ultimately, burnout.

In high-stress environments, such as martial arts tournaments, experienced competitors are often distinguished by their ability to relax and conserve energy during periods of downtime, as opposed to maintaining a constant state of high alertness. They understand that life's pivotal moments are typically interspersed within long periods of relative calm and uneventful time. Thus, they have learned to value these periods as part of their lives rather than simply as waiting periods for the next big event.

We can learn from this approach by redefining our perception of "waiting". Instead of viewing these periods as meaningless interludes in our lives, we can learn to appreciate and fully engage in them. An ability to deeply engage with the simplicity of everyday life can lead to discovery of life's hidden richness and fulfillment. Furthermore, this ability to immerse ourselves in the present moment can potentially allow us to recognize and seize life-altering opportunities when they arise.

This mindset extends to performance preparation as well. High-stress situations should not be overly emphasized or singled out. Rather, the goal should be to integrate positive, healthy habits into our daily lives, which will then come naturally in critical moments. Success is thus the result of consistent, incremental growth, akin to the gradual, steady process of water carving stone.

One effective method to cultivate this balanced state of mind involves creating a personalized routine that promotes relaxation and tranquility. This involves identifying one's most relaxing activity and incorporating it into a daily routine alongside other relaxing activities. Over time, this routine becomes a catalyst for calmness and peace that can be deployed in high-stress situations. Eventually, the routine itself becomes a mental trigger, capable of inducing a relaxed state of mind with just a simple thought or action.

The adoption of such a routine creates a physiological link between the calming routine and the subsequent activity, enabling the practitioner to evoke a calm state of mind before embarking on any high-pressure task. Over time, this heightened state of awareness begins to permeate every aspect of life, transforming mundane experiences into a source of joy and inspiration. This new perspective allows for the interconnectedness of all experiences, transforming the simple and mundane into valuable life lessons. As a result, each moment becomes richly intertwined, offering an endless source of learning and growth.

> One of the biggest roadblocks to releasing the tension during breaks of intense competition or in any other kind of challenging environment is the fear of whether we will be able to get it back. If getting focused is hit or miss, how can we give up our focus once we've finally got it? Conditioning to this insecurity begins young. As children, we might be told to "concentrate" by parents and teachers, and then be reprimanded if we look off into the stars. So the child learns to associate not focusing with being "bad". The result is that we concentrate with everything we've got until we can't withstand the pressure and have a meltdown. 

> In the martial arts world, this theme is also critical. The ability to wait for hours on end without exploding with tension or losing your edge is often what separates the top fighters before they step in the ring. Big tournaments involve a lot of downtime between matches. Some fighters keep themselves in a state of feverish alertness, always poised for action for fear their moment might come and they won't be ready. The more seasoned competitors relax, listen to headphones, and nap. They don't burn through their thanks before stepping on the mats.

> We don't live within a Hollywood screenplay where the crescendo erupts just when we want it to, and more often than not the climactic moments in our lives will follow many unclimactic, normal humdrum hours, days, weeks, or years. So how do we step up when our moment suddenly arises?
> 
> My answer is to redefine the question. Not only do we have to be good at waiting, we have to love it. Because waiting is not waiting, it is life. Too many of us live without fully engaging our minds, waiting for that moment when our real lives begin. Years pass in boredom, but that is okay because when our true love comes around, or we discover our real calling, we will begin. Of course the sad truth is that if we are not present to the moment, our true love could come and go and we wouldn’t even notice. And we will have become someone other than the you or I who would be able to embrace it. I believe an appreciation for simplicity, the everyday—the ability to dive deeply into the banal and discover life’s hidden richness—is where success, let alone happiness, emerges.

> Along these lines, when considering the issue of performance state, it is important to avoid focusing on those rare climactic moments of high-stakes competitive mayhem. If you get into a frenzy anticipating the moment that will decide your destiny, then when it arrives you will be overwrought with excitement and tension. To have success in crunch time, you need to integrate certain healthy patterns into your day-to-day life so that they are completely natural to you when the pressure is on. The real power of incremental growth comes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just keep on flowing when everything is on the line. 

> The point to this system of creating your own trigger is that a physiological connection is formed between the routine and the activity it precedes. Once the routine is internalized, it can be used before any activity and a similar state of mind will emerge. 

> Once a simple inhalation can trigger a state of tremendous alertness, our moment-to-moment awareness becomes blissful, like that of someone half-blind who puts on glasses for the first time. We see more as we walk down the street. The everyday becomes exquisitely beautiful. The notion of boredom becomes alien and absurd as we naturally soak in the lovely subtleties of the “banal.” All experiences become richly intertwined by our new vision, and then new connections begin to emerge. Rainwater streaming on a city pavement will teach a pianist how to flow. A leaf gliding easily with the wind will teach a controller how to let go. A housecat will teach me how to move. All moments become each moment.

> Every one of us has one or more activities or experiences that can lead us toward serenity. To create your own catalyst for peak performance (in other words, to "build your trigger"), first identify the one key activity that is _most_ relaxing for you. Then shape a simple routine comprising this and four to five additional personal relaxation methods _you know work for you_. Practice this routine daily for one month during down time to entrench a calm state of mind.
> 
> If you can only identify _a single_ activity that leads you to serenity, shape a routine of simple activities to practice before or after your known relaxation producer. After a month of practice, the soothing psychological benefits of your key activity will have suffused the routine; you will be able to use the routine to produce a state of calmness even when the key activity is not a part of it.
> 
> In both cases, the routine should be of your choosing but could, for instance, include a few minutes each of jogging, bathing, showering, walking, eating a snack, snuggling with a loved one, listening to a song, smelling something pleasing, or meditating. By the end of the month, you will have internalized a deeper sense of peace and reaped many physiological benefits. You can then use your routine as a prelude to a high-stress activity in order to enhance your psychological state and build a solid foundation for excelling—before critical moments at work, school and on the playing field. Gradually and incrementally condense the routine. In short order, you will be able to produce all its benefits by merely thinking about it or practicing a few seconds of it. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/peak-performance/build-your-trigger/
