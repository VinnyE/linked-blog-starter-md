Effective problem-solving requires a meticulous approach that breaks down the problem into manageable, logical components. This approach helps to identify the root causes (see: [[First principles thinking and its evolving nature]]) of the problem and potential pathways to the solution. By dissecting the problem in this manner, we can also discern the aspects that may be too challenging to alter or do not contribute significantly to the problem, and hence, could be set aside. 

Logic trees serve as structural guides in this dissection process. Essentially, they are a map for your problem (but remember, [[The map is not the territory - abstractions must be distinguished from reality]]). They facilitate visualization of different tiers of the problem, analogized as trunks, branches, twigs, and leaves. Ideally, logic trees should represent clear and comprehensive relationships between these elements, with no overlaps. These logic trees can help transition from general problem elements to specific hypotheses for testing, as vague labels do not facilitate actionable analysis.

The initial problem-solving phase in [[Bulletproof Problem Solving ]]usually employs a simpler kind of logic tree, referred to as a component or factor tree, that represents the fundamental elements of a problem. This approach prioritizes components that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE), ensuring a thorough analysis.

Deductive and inductive logic trees form the basis of more complex problem-solving strategies. Deductive logic trees, named after the process of logical deduction, operate on the principle of top-down reasoning. They transition from general rules to specific conclusions. This type of logic tree is particularly beneficial when the problem's logical structure is well-understood and mathematically defined.

On the other hand, inductive logic trees, based on inductive reasoning, work from specific observations towards general principles. These are employed when general principles behind the problem are less known, but specific case data or insights are available. These trees display probabilistic relationships rather than causal ones. It is not uncommon to employ both deductive and inductive reasoning while working on the initial tree.

Note: [[We should be careful with inductive reasoning and the kind of logical leaps that can result from it]]

> We learned the power of logic trees at McKinsey and continue to find them essential to good problem solving. Why? Because they do the following: 
	- Provide a clear visual representation of the problem so that everyone can understand the component parts. 
	- Done correctly, they are holistic in the sense that everything relevant is captured in the tree.
	- Lead to clear hypotheses that can be tested with data and analysis.

> The most important step is to disaggregate the problem in a logical way into component parts, so you can isolate the most important analyses; logic trees are our prime work tool—they make it easy to see the structure of the problem.

> Any problem of real consequence is too complicated to solve without breaking it down into logical parts that help us understand the drivers or causes of the situation. So this is the most important step in problem solving: taking the problem apart in a way that helps us see the potential pathways to solve it. At the same time, when we can see all the parts clearly, we can determine what not to work on, the bits that are either too difficult to change, or that don't impact the problem much. When you get good at cleaving problems apart, insights come quickly. The magic comes in seeing which type of logic tree makes an elegant solution more obvious. It is like a plan to cut a diamond—doing it the right way really matters.

> Think of a logic tree as a mental model of your problem. Better trees have a clearer and more complete logic of relationships linking the parts to each other, are more comprehensive, and have no overlaps—but we'll get to all that.

> At the very beginning, when you are able to state your problem clearly but don't yet have a detailed understanding of the problem to provide a vantage point on the solution, it usually makes sense to employ the simplest kind of tree, a component or factor tree. Components or factors are just the most obvious elements that make up a problem, like the bricks and mortar of our earlier brick wall example.

> Deductive logic trees take their name from the process of logical deduction. Deductive reasoning is sometimes called top–down reasoning, because when we apply it we argue from general rules or principles to conclusions via more specific data and assertions. A classic kind of deductive statement is structured like this: 
> - General statement: All watchmakers need glasses. 
> - Specific observation: Sally is a watchmaker. 
> - Deductive conclusion: Sally needs glasses.

> Deductive logic trees are constructed similarly, with a problem statement that may sometimes be expressed in quantities, and branches that are typically logically or mathematically complete, so that the components add up to the desired objective of the problem statement. We use this kind of tree when we know a lot about the logical structure of a problem, and especially when the cleaving frame is inherently mathematical

> Inductive logic trees are the reverse of deductive logic trees. They take their name from the process of inductive reasoning, which works from specific observations toward general principles. 

> We employ inductive logic trees when we do not yet know much about the general principles behind the problems we are interested in, but we do have some data or insights into specific cases. Inductive trees show probabilistic relationships, not causal ones: Just because all the swans you have seen are white, does not mean all swans are white (there are black swans in Australia.2) In many cases you will actually work on your initial tree both inductively and deductively.
