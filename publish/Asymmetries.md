Asymmetries is a concept within [[Probabalistic thinking]] that refers to an imbalance or unequal distribution of outcomes, which can be important when dealing with complex or unpredictable systems. Recognizing and accounting for asymmetries in decision-making processes can lead to a better understanding of potential outcomes of a situation. Yet another way we can [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]

Examples of Asymmetries:
- [[Pareto Principle]] - i.e 20% of inputs lead to significant portion of the outputs. 
- Peoples ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. From the book:
> Another common asymmetry is people’s ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% late? All the time? Exactly. Your estimation errors are asymmetric, skewing in a single direction. This is often the case with probabilistic decision-making. - Parrish, S. (2019). _The Great Mental Models: General thinking concepts. Latticework Publishing_.
