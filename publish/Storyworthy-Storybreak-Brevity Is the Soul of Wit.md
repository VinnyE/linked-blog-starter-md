In storytelling, less is often more. Keeping your story brief and concise not only makes it more digestible for your audience, but it also reduces the pressure to be constantly engaging or amusing. However, achieving brevity is a craft—it means making tough decisions about what to include and what to omit, and it requires careful word choice and structure. So, while a shorter story might be more challenging to create, the end result is often superior.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Power of Brevity
Brevity in storytelling is highly valued. Shorter narratives are often more impactful and memorable for the audience. A concise story removes the necessity to be constantly engaging or entertaining, making it more accessible for both the storyteller and the listener.

### The Challenge of Brevity
Achieving brevity is not a simple task. It requires making tough decisions about what parts of the story to keep and what to leave out. This process involves careful crafting of words and phrases, and clever construction of the overall narrative.

### The Quality of Brevity
Although creating a concise story is challenging, the effort often results in a superior narrative. A shorter story, expertly crafted and wisely edited, can resonate more deeply with the audience, leaving a lasting impact.

> In storytelling, you should always try to say less. Shorter is better. Fewer words rule. The twenty-minute commencement address is almost always better than the forty-minute address. The thirty-minute meeting is almost always more effective than the sixty-minute meeting. The six-minute story is almost always better than the ten-minute story. And yes, the shorter sermon is always better than the longer sermon.

> As Blaise Pascal first said, "If I had more time, I would have written you a shorter letter." Brevity takes time, because brevity is always better. The longer you speak, the more engaging, amusing, and captivating you must be. That's a tall order. Those are high expectations. Most people are not engaging, amusing, or captivating by nature.

> But that's okay. As the sign says, you don't have to be nearly as good if you can be quick. Shorter is also harder. I often tell storytellers that it’s easy to tell an eight- to ten-minute story. Almost anyone can find a way to get from beginning to end in ten minutes. But it’s hard to tell a five- to six-minute story. It means making difficult choices about what will stay and what will go. It requires careful crafting and clever construction. Words and phrases must be expertly manipulated. Your choices must be spot-on. But the results are often superior.
