By transcending physical limitations, [[Thought experiments]] help us examine scenarios from multiple perspectives, enhancing our understanding of various subjects. They enable us to re-imagine history through historical counter-factual and semi-factual scenarios, pondering alternate outcomes had certain events happened differently. The technique has been employed by renowned thinkers, such as Albert Einstein, who used it to examine problems that were difficult or impossible to solve physically. In our everyday lives, we use thought experiments when we ponder hypothetical scenarios, such as what we would do if money or time were not constraints. These mental exercises help us gain insights into our values and priorities.

It's important to remember that thought experiments do not come without risk. We must exercise caution when drawing conclusions from these thought experiments, as history is a chaotic system where small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes. See [[Understanding trends and laws in human history]].

> Albert Einstein was a great user of the thought experiment because it is a way to logically carry out a test in one’s own head that would be very difficult or impossible to perform in real life. With this tool, we can solve problems with intuition and logic that cannot be demonstrated physically.

> This type of thought experiment need not only apply to physics and is actually reflected in some of our common expressions. When we say “if money were no object” or “if you had all the time in the world,” we are asking someone to conduct a thought experiment because actually removing that variable (money or time) is physically impossible. In reality, money is always an object, and we never have all the time in the world. But the act of detailing out the choices we would make in these alternate realities that have otherwise similar properties to our current one, doing the thought experiment, is what leads to insights regarding what we value in life and where to focus our energies.

> A familiar use of the thought experiment is to re-imagine history. This one we all use, all the time. What if I hadn’t been stuck at the airport bar where I met my future business partner? Would World War I have started if Gavrilo Princip hadn’t shot the Archduke of Austria in Sarajevo? If Cleopatra hadn’t found a way to meet Caesar, would she still have been able to take the throne of Egypt? These approaches are called the historical counter-factual and semi-factual. If Y happened instead of X, what would the outcome have been? Would the outcome have been the same? As popular—and generally useful—as counter- and semi-factuals are, they are also the areas of thought experiment with which we need to use the most caution. Why? Because history is what we call a chaotic system. A small change in the beginning conditions can cause a very different outcome down the line. This is where the rigor of the scientific method is indispensable if we want to draw conclusions that are actually useful.
