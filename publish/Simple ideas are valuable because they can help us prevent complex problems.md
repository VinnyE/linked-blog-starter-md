title: "Simple ideas are valuable because they can help us prevent complex problems"

People often overlook the power of simple ideas, focusing instead on developing specialized knowledge ([[Arm yourself with specific knowledge to achieve greater success, impact, and fulfillment]]) to set themselves apart. However, it is essential to recognize that simple ideas, drawn from various disciplines, can help prevent complex problems and foster a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the world ([[Recognize the interconnectedness of the self and the world around us to open a pathway to empathy and understanding]].) [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]. One way to achieve this is by [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]]. 

By embracing these elementary concepts, we can better comprehend causal relationships, identify patterns, and draw analogies, allowing us to navigate reality with greater clarity and insight into the underlying dynamics. Emphasizing simplicity rather than complexity can enable us to thrive and lead others by tapping into the unrecognized potential of fundamental principles. In essence, by leveraging simple ideas from multiple disciplines we can start to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]. 

This power of simple ideas also reminds me a bit of Dan Koe's philosophy towards solopreneurship. He believes that [everyone has $100,000 worth of knowledge trapped in their brains](https://thedankoe.com/you-have-100000-of-knowledge-trapped-in-your-brain/) that they can share and monetize, and that you can get a long way by sharing the basics of something because that's where the top of the funnel is.

>  We also tend to undervalue the elementary ideas and overvalue the complicated ones. Most of us get jobs based on some form of specialized knowledge, so this makes sense. We don’t think we have much value if we know the things everyone else does, so we focus our effort on developing unique expertise to set ourselves apart. The problem is then that we reject the simple to make sure what we offer can’t be contributed by someone else. But simple ideas are of great value because they can help us prevent complex problems

>  These elementary ideas, so often overlooked, are from multiple disciplines: biology, physics, chemistry, and more. These help us understand the interconnections of the world, and see it for how it really is. This understanding allows us to develop causal relationships, which allow us to match patterns, which allow us to draw analogies. All of this so we can navigate reality with more clarity and comprehension of the real dynamics involved.
