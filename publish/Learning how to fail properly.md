Learning how to fail properly is a key concept (along with [[Upside optionality]]) to absorb if we want to learn how to arm ourselves with [[The Antifragile Mindset]]. 

This involves two key components: never taking risks that could lead to complete ruin and developing personal resilience to bounce back from setbacks. By adhering to these principles, and actively making an [[Investment in loss]], failures become temporary rather than permanent obstacles, ultimately strengthening one's ability to adapt and grow in the face of adversity.

Embracing failure as a learning opportunity is a hallmark of [[The Antifragile Mindset]]. Those who are unafraid to fail and willing to learn from their experiences are better equipped to navigate the unpredictable nature of the world. In this way, failure becomes a gift, making individuals less vulnerable to the volatility they will inevitably face.

> The second thing we can do is to learn how to fail properly. Failing properly has two major components. First, never take a risk that will do you in completely. (Never get taken out of the game completely.) Second, develop the personal resilience to learn from your failures and start again. With these two rules, you can only fail temporarily.

>  No one likes to fail. It hurts. But failure carries with it one huge antifragile gift: learning. Those who are not afraid to fail (properly) have a huge advantage over the rest. What they learn makes them less vulnerable to the volatility of the world. They benefit from it, in true antifragile fashion.
