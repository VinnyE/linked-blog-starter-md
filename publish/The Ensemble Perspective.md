Shifting our perception from viewing ourselves as the main character in the narrative of our lives to one of many in an ensemble cast can transform our relationships. In this perspective, friends, family, and colleagues are seen as partners in our journey, not mere supporting characters. This shift allows us to appreciate the richness and diversity of our shared experiences and creates a more meaningful drama of life.
