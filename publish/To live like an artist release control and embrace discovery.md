title: "To live like an artist release control and embrace discovery"

Just like the unpredictability of an artist's creation, life doesn't come with a preset path or a foolproof plan. Living like an artist implies embracing uncertainty, learning from experiences, adjusting along the way, and valuing the process over the predetermined outcome. We can't predict the twists and turns, but we can adapt and create meaning from them. We also learn to balance optionality - saying both yes to new, uncertain opportunities and no to avoid being overwhelmed. Not always being in control doesn't mean there is no control; it simply indicates our openness to readjust our journey based on newfound information. Conversations become exploratory instead of transactional, life decisions a careful craft, and the act of living an artistic exercise in continuous revision and self-reflection. Like writing and revising a book, the story of life unfolds as we go along. Thus, being aimless occasionally aids in discovering where to aim, and sometimes, just being attentive in the present is the most active form of engagement with life.

## Concept Breakdown

[[Embracing Uncertainty]]

[[Navigating Optionality]]

[[Control in life isn't about predefining every step, but more about the ability to adapt to new information and experiences]]

[[Conversations should not be led by transactional goals or predefined outcomes. Instead, they should be allowed to take their own course, opening up to unexpected directions and revelations]]

[[There is no rule book for life decisions. Understanding when to persevere and when to quit is a craft to be cultivated over time]]

[[Living as Continuous Revision]]

[[Sometimes, the most meaningful action is to wait attentively, to slow down and observe]]

> William Faulkner once described writing a book as getting "the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he's true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says." Unlike some novelists, Faulkner was claiming he didn't know how his book was going to turn out when he started. The characters he created and the situations he put them in took on a life of their own. There was an organic aspect to the process that defied the usual way we think of a genius at work, executing a brilliant plan to realize the vision. The vision emerges alongside the work. It isn't prefabricated.

> Most of us don't have a prefab career or life. We don't know what we want. We find ourselves in Rome, with little or no idea of what exactly is best for us to do. What we want, what we enjoy, what gives our lives meaning, emerges from the choices we make, and that emergence takes place alongside the choices and what we learn from living with those choices, adjusting what we do accordingly. We figure out what we want not from studying it from our armchair or by looking it up in a book or consulting experts but from actual day-to-day experience. And until we have that day-to-day experience, and until we feel what it’s like to put on a particular identity, we don’t have a goal in the usual sense of that word. 

> Living like an artist is not a bad way to think about how to face a wild problem. 

> Can we think of our lives as something we craft with an understanding that the result is not completely and sometimes hardly at all under our control? 

> We think of things that are not under our control as out of control, like some crazy amusement park ride where we have no idea of what's coming around the next turn. But recognizing that you are not in control doesn't mean there's no control at all or zero planning. It means trusting the opportunity to adjust the plan or journey to the new information that you learn as you go through the experience. It's like a week in Rome without a guidebook. It's like when you go into a skid on an icy road. Your natural reaction is to reclaim control of the car and turn the wheel back toward where you want to go or hit the brakes hard. But those actions usually make the skid worse. Sometimes it's better to simply take your foot off the gas and let the car regain its footing on its own.

> Living like an artist means being open to discovery about the world and about yourself. As educator Lorne Buchman explores in his book Make to Know, poets, sculptors, novelists, and composers learn about what they are crafting in the process of crafting it. They don't start with an algorithm unless you consider "remove all the marble that isn't David" an algorithm for Michelangelo. Or "pick the right note that belongs after the ones that came before" as Beethoven seems to have proceeded.

> Artists often have no idea what they’re going to create. They make art in order to know what they are planning. Buchman quotes Picasso: “To know what you’re going to draw, you have to begin drawing.” Elizabeth Bishop discovered what she wanted to say in the process of saying it. So it is with life.

> One practical aspect of living like an artist ties in with optionality. One of the best pieces of advices I've ever heard is the importance of saying no. If you're not careful, you'll find yourself bogged down by too many commitments, wasting time on trivial tasks and failing to achieve what you care most about. You won't be able to realize your plans–you're always getting sidetracked. It's also one of the worst pieces of advice– if you always or too often say no, you’ll miss a chance to connect with someone you will be glad to know, to discover something special or, even better, something precious. You’ll reduce the amount of serendipity in your life. Taking advantage of optionality means saying yes to things that are not obviously worth doing but have the chance to expand your horizons, your experiences, your connections. And by doing so you will learn not just about opportunities but about yourself—what you like and what you find meaningful.

> To know when to fold ’em and when to hold ’em is an art that is quantifiable in poker but not in life. Better to learn who you are—your strengths and limitations—and make each decision as best you can. Here is a case where having a rule—“always persevere,” or “quit when it gets too hard”—will lead you astray. In life, knowing when to persevere and when to quit is a craft to cultivate. 

> Some of the most unforgettable conversations I've had in my life came when I was just there to listen, when I was able to see myself as something other than the star of the story. I didn't have a plan on what I was going to accomplish in the conversations, I was just present when a stranger opened her heart to me about a tragedy in her life. It doesn't happen often, but it's a powerful skill to be present without judgment. Instead of entering a conversation with a fundamentally transactional plan—What can I get out of this?—the “star of the story” mindset, approach conversations more like an artist. Avoid having a set of goals. Rather than planning on steering the conversation, let it take its own path. The best conversations go in unexpected directions and end up in places of intimacy, revelation, or education. The conversation, like a work of art, takes on a life of its own. You give up some control and in return the heart opens.

> Living like an artist doesn’t mean you never plan or that you sit around and wait for life to sweep you off your feet. It means appreciating that how you interact with your experiences has a life of its own.

> Another way to think about life as an artist comes from the act of writing. In Theory, it's possible to carefully craft each sentence, and the best writer is the one who patiently finds just the right word and spins sentence after sentence in a beautiful web. I once thought that was the way Flaubert wrote, for example–that his first draft was basically his final draft. But it's not true. Flaubert was a relentless reviser, doing draft after draft until he was satisfied.

> When science fiction author Orson Scott Card teaches creative writing, he has the students give one another feedback on their drafts. But instead of grading the students based on their final essays, he grades them on the quality of the feedback they gave their classmates. His insight was that becoming a great writer requires becoming a great editor—learning to revise is essential to writing well. That’s true of life, too. Don’t worry about the rough draft. As long as you’re able to kill your darlings and take advantage of optionality, you will thrive.

> The last way to exploit the idea of living like an artist is to see yourself as the work of art, the economist James Buchanan’s “artifactual man” from chapter 9, the idea of seeing yourself as an artifact. Imagine living like an artist where you and your life are the art. What would that mean? It would mean you see yourself as the clay to be molded, the marble to be sculpted. It means to see yourself and your life as a work in progress. 

> Life is like a book that you are writing and reading at the same time. You might have a plan for how it turns out. But for it to be a great book, it needs to be savored and chewed and digested along the way, like a book that you read that changes your life. And you have to prepare for a plot twist and maybe two or three.

> You might imagine you can script a book or a poem or your life and have it come out the way you plan. But the lesson of the first half of this book is that the book you want to inhabit when you're a teenager or in your twenties may not be the best book for you as you get older. You need to let the book have its own way with you. This perspectives requires a level of self-awareness that usually comes with age and experience. It requires a level of aspiration I wrote about earlier–of thinking about what you want to become at least in general, even if you don't know the precise shape or outline of what you are striving toward. It might simple be "better"–to be a better person this year than last year.

> The artist comes into the world with a set of skills. We all do. How are we to use those skills? What are we to fashion from those skills? How can we enhance those skills so as to make even better art out of our lives? How do we take the soil we find ourselves in and transform what we begin with to make it into something beautiful, a work of art?

> Sometimes being aimless helps you discover where to aim. Sometimes it’s better to sit and wait and watch and see what happens. Sometimes doing your utmost means merely waiting. But it’s not waiting idly. It’s waiting attentively. It’s about paying attention. Sometimes doing your utmost means doing nothing but being ready for what comes next. Slowing down can help you see it, when it arrives.
