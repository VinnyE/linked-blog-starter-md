### The Problem with 'Best'
In the context of finding a life partner, the term 'best' poses significant issues. It implies a singular, unidimensional metric for comparison, which is incompatible with the complex and dynamic nature of human beings. A potential spouse is not just one characteristic, but a matrix of virtues, vices, attributes, and traits that cannot be measured solely on a single scale.
