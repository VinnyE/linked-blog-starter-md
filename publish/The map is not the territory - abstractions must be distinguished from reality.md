title: "The map is not the territory - abstractions must be distinguished from reality"

Our understanding of the world is inherently limited by the abstractions we use to navigate it. The concept of "the map is not the territory," introduced by mathematician Alfred Korzybski, emphasizes that the description or model of a thing is not the thing itself. It is a sort of mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) that emphasizes that the map is an abstraction and not the actual territory. 

As we consume information, like news articles, we must be aware that we are processing someone else's interpretation of reality and may lose important details in the process. Recognizing the difference between maps and reality is essential for making better decisions and avoiding overconfidence in our understanding. Remember that [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]]. To use maps effectively and  [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]], we need to [[Embrace critical thinking for effective use of maps and models]].

This also reminds me a bit of what Emerson said about second-hand borrowing books in [[First We Read, Then We Write]]:

> Avoid all second-hand borrowing books-`Collections of , `Beauties of , etc. I see you have some on your shelves. I would burn them. No one can select the beautiful passages of another for you. It is beautiful for him-well! Another thought, wedding your aspirations, will be the thing of beauty for you. Do your own quarrying

> In 1931, the mathematician Alfred Korzybski presented a paper on mathematical semantics in New Orleans, Louisiana. Looking at it today, most of the paper reads like a complex, technical argument on the relationship of mathematics to human language, and of both to physical reality. However, with this paper Korzybski introduced and popularized the concept that the map is not the territory. In other words, the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. The abstraction is not the abstracted.

> The truth is, the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction. When we read the news, we’re consuming abstractions created by other people. The authors consumed vast amounts of information, reflected upon it, and drew some abstractions and conclusions that they share with us. But something is lost in the process. We can lose the specific and relevant details that were distilled into an abstraction. And, because we often consume these abstractions as gospel, without having done the hard mental work ourselves, it’s tricky to see when the map no longer agrees with the territory. We inadvertently forget that the map is not reality.
