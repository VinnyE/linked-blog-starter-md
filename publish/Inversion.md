Inversion, another sort of mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]), involves reimagining a problem or situation by approaching it from its opposite end. Instead of merely progressing forward in a linear fashion, inversion encourages backward thinking, thereby providing a more comprehensive and varied understanding of a problem. This technique can prove instrumental in avoiding potential pitfalls and achieving success, underscoring the adage that averting mistakes is often simpler than striving for brilliance (see: [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]).

**Some examples of applied Inversion**: 
1. Edward Bernays provides a notable example of the application of inversion in his promotion of smoking for women. See [[Torches of Freedom]].
2. Index funds, as promoted by Vanguard's John Bogle, offer another case of inversion's effectiveness. Rather than attempting to beat the market — a task proven challenging and inconsistent — Bogle inverted the question to focus on minimizing investor losses. This shift led to a more reliable and safer investment method, which subsequently facilitated the accumulation of wealth for many investors.
3. In the field of psychology, Kurt Lewin's [[Force field analysis]].
4. Marie Van Brittan Brown, a nurse who felt unsafe in her home, used inversion to pioneer the home security system. Instead of focusing on how to respond to a potential threat, she designed a system that would prevent the threat from materializing in the first place.

In essence, inversion promotes innovative thinking by encouraging individuals to approach problems from a reversed perspective. Whether it's avoiding detrimental decisions or fostering creative solutions, inversion is a valuable tool in problem-solving and strategic planning.

> Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is “invert,” which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point. Most of us tend to think one way about a problem: forward. Inversion allows us to flip the problem around and think backward. Sometimes it’s good to start at the beginning, but it can be more useful to start at the end. Think of it this way: Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance. Combining the ability to think forward and backward allows you to see reality from multiple angles.

> Instead of thinking through the achievement of a positive outcome, we could ask ourselves how we might achieve a terrible outcome, and let that guide our decision-making. Index funds are a great example of stock market inversion promoted and brought to bear by Vanguard’s John Bogle. Instead of asking how to beat the market, as so many before him, Bogle recognized the difficulty of the task. Everyone is trying to beat the market. No one is doing it with any consistency, and in the process real people are losing actual money. So he inverted the approach

> We can more readily secure wealth by using inversion to make sure we are not doing the worst things that prevent the accumulation of wealth. 

> Marie Van Brittan Brown, who, along with her husband Albert Brown, filed the first patent for a closed circuit monitoring system in 1966. She was a nurse, living in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York, and as such worked irregular hours. When she was home alone, she felt unsafe. In an interesting example of inversion, she decided to do something about it. 

> She reflected on the knowledge that could be derived from statistics and, in another instance of inversion thinking, she advocated for their use as a means of prevention. It became not so much “how do we fix this problem,” but “how do we stop it from happening in the first place.”

> Simply invert, always invert, when you are stuck. If you take the results of your inversion seriously, you might make a great deal of progress on solving your problems.
