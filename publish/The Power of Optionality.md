Optionality, when we're good at [[Navigating Optionality]] that is, presents a powerful life strategy that allows freedom without obligation. This concept, demonstrated by Zappos' shoe-buying experience, promotes exploring more experiences rather than trying to predict the perfect choice. It encourages taking chances, provided we have the freedom to opt out without significant cost. It's about embracing the unknown and letting life unfold organically, like venture capitalists who understand the reality of striking out more often than they hit a unicorn.
