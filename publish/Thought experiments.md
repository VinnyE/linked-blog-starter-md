Thought experiments are another mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) we can rely on to [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]. They serve as powerful tools for exploring diverse aspects of the world (see: [[Thought experiments in ethics, morality, and society]]) and human nature by engaging our imagination and intuition. These imaginative exercises allow us to investigate the nature of things, learn from past mistakes, evaluate potential consequences, and make better decisions without incurring physical costs (see: [[Applications and benefits of thought experiments]]). 

The thought experiment process often mirrors the scientific method, involving questioning, conducting background research, constructing hypotheses, testing them in our minds (see: [[The principle of falsifiability in science]]), and analyzing outcomes.

> Thought experiments can be defined as “devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.”

> Thought experiments are powerful because they help us learn from our mistakes and avoid future ones. They let us take on the impossible, evaluate the potential consequences of our actions, and re-examine history to make better decisions. They can help us both figure out what we really want, and the best way to get there. 

> Its chief value is that it lets us do things in our heads we cannot do in real life, and so explore situations from more angles than we can physically examine and test for. 

> Much like the scientific method, a thought experiment generally has the following steps: Ask a question Conduct background research Construct hypothesis Test with (thought) experiments Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions Compare to hypothesis and adjust accordingly (new question, etc.)

>  Intuiting the non-intuitive: One of the uses of thought experiments is to improve our ability to intuit the non-intuitive. In other words, a thought experiment allows us to verify if our natural intuition is correct by running experiments in our deliberate, conscious minds that make a point clear.
