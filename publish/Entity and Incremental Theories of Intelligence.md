title: Entity and Incremental Theories of Intelligence

These are two distinct viewpoints on learning and intelligence proposed by developmental psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck. Entity theorists perceive their intelligence or skill levels to be inherent and unchangeable, attributing their success or failure to innate ability. Incremental theorists, or learning theorists, believe in the possibility of growth and improvement through hard work. They perceive mastering material as a gradual process, acknowledging the role of effort and determination in overcoming challenges.

Why is this important? Because [[Success and failure in different fields can be heavily influenced by an individual's theory of intelligence]]
