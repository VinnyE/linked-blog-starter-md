Stories need stakes, the reasons an audience continues listening, to be compelling. Effective storytellers employ strategies to raise stakes, like presenting the reason for listening early, building anticipation, hinting at future events, slowing the pace, making false predictions, and using humor.

## Concept Breakdown

### Present the reason for listening early
The "elephant" gives the audience an early sense of what the story is about by stating the need, want, problem or mystery. Without it, audiences may stop listening. The best elephants appear within the first minute.

### Build anticipation
The "backpack" increases stakes by conveying the storyteller's hopes and fears before moving the story forward. It helps the audience experience similar emotions and wonder what will happen next. Backpacks work best when plans go awry.

### Hint at future events
"Breadcrumbs" are hints at future events that keep audiences guessing without revealing too much. They create the most wonder when the unexpected is coming.

### Slow the pace
The "hourglass" slows the pace and adds details when audiences are most engaged. It makes them wait longer to hear what they're anticipating.

### Make false predictions
The "crystal ball" is a false prediction about what might happen next, causing audiences to wonder if it will come true. We frequently make predictions in everyday life, so including them makes stories more relatable.

### Use humor (optional)
Humor keeps audiences listening during less compelling parts of a story. It's optional and cannot replace stakes, which are essential. If a story lacks meaningful stakes, humor alone cannot make it great.

> Simply defined, stakes are the reason audiences listen and continue to listen to a story. Stakes answer questions like:
	 •     What does the storyteller want or need?
	 •     What is at peril?
	 •     What is the storyteller fighting for or against?
	 •     What will happen next?
	 •     How is this story going to turn out

> Stakes are the reason an audience wants to hear your next sentence. They are the difference between a story that grabs the audience by the throat and holds on tight and one that an audience can take or leave. Stakes are the difference between someone telling you about their mother and someone telling you about the time they wanted to disown their mother. Stakes are the reason we ride roller-coasters. They are why we climb trees and arm wrestle or race our friends across the backyard. Stakes are why sports dominate our culture and why asking a girl on a date can be so difficult. Stakes are the Nazis and the snakes in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Darth Vader and his storm troopers in Star Wars. The iceberg in Titanic. The dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. Stakes are the reason we listen to stories when video games and pizza and sex exist in the world. We could be doing any one of these things, but we listen to stories because we want to know what happens next. In the best stories, we want to hear the next sentence. And the sentence after that. And the sentence after that.

> Just imagine if I asked a friend, “Would you like to go to a movie where a man who does not believe in God ultimately finds the faith required to save himself and the woman he loves?” The answer would probably be no. No, thank you. I don’t want to see that movie. Instead I say, “Do you want to go see Raiders of the Lost Ark? It’s a movie about an archeologist-turned-hero who must battle Nazis, snakes, booby traps, and evil scientists in order to save the world?” The answer is more likely to be yes. The Nazis and snakes are the stakes. They are the things that keep our attention scene to scene. They are the reason we buy a ticket and popcorn and give up two hours of our life.

##### Five strategies to infuse a story with stakes:

**The elephant**
> Every story must have an Elephant. The Elephant is the thing that everyone in the room can see. It is large and obvious. It is a clear statement of the need, the want, the problem, the peril, or the mystery. It signifies where the story is headed, and it makes it clear to your audience that this is in fact a story and not a simple musing on a subject.
> 
> Elephants are critical to the success of a story. Movies have trailers and summaries that you can read on websites like Rotten Tomatoes to inform you of the gist of the story. Storytellers don't have the benefit of a trailer. When a storyteller begins speaking, whether in a theater or dining room or a conference room, the audience often has no idea what to expect. Are we in the midst of a comedy? A drama? The audience doesn’t know why they are listening to the story or what is to come, so it’s easy to stop listening. If you don’t present a reason to listen very early on, you risk losing their attention altogether. The Elephant tells the audience what to expect. It gives them a reason to listen, a reason to wonder. It infuses the story with instantaneous stakes. The Elephant should appear as early in the story as possible. Ideally, it should appear within the first minute, and if you can say it within the first thirty seconds, even better.

> The Elephant is the difference between these two beginnings of a story: 
> Version #1:
>"My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The model of decorum and civility. She served as PTO president and treasurer of the ladies’ auxiliary. She was the only female umpire in our town’s Little League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound. "

> Version #2:
> "I don’t care how perfect my mother was. When I was nine years old, I wanted to disown her. Leave home and never return. Forget she ever existed. My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The model of decorum and civility. She served as PTO president and treasurer of the ladies’ auxiliary. She was the only female umpire in our town’s Little League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound. "

> The first story offers a character sketch of the storyteller’s mother. We have no idea what kind of story we are listening to, so it’s easy for us to check out at this point. Nothing is at stake. There is no wonder. We don’t need to hear the next sentence. The second story starts with an Elephant. It contains exactly the same character description, but it opens with a clear explanation of what to expect. Three simple sentences at the start of the story change our perception about everything that follows. 

>Elephants can also change color. That is, the need, want, problem, peril, or mystery stated in the beginning of the story can change along the way. You may be offered one expectation only to have it pulled away in favor of another. Start with a gray Elephant. End with a pink one. 

>In "Charity Thief," the Elephant that I present at the beginning of the story is a simple one: I'm stuck in New Hampshire with a flat tire and no spare. Eventually the Elephant in my story changes color. The story isn’t really about escaping New Hampshire at all. It’s really a story about understanding the nature of loneliness. I change the color of the Elephant halfway through this story. I present the audience with one Elephant, but then I paint it another color. I trick them. This is an excellent storytelling strategy: make your audience think they are on one path, and then when they least expect it, show them that they have been on a different path all along. Note that I'm not actually changing the path that the audience is on. It's the same path we've been walking since the start of the story. The audience just didn't realize that it's a much deeper, more interesting path than first expected. Don't switch the elephants. Simply change the color. 

>This method of storytelling is especially effective when the end of your story is heavy, emotional, sorrowful, or heartrending. To keep an entire story from being filled with weight and emotion, I try to find a way to make the beginning light and fun, hilarious and joyous. I present an Elephant that is happy, adventurous, and amusing to contrast with the weight, the sadness, and solemnity at the end. 

>Filmmakers almost always present an Elephant at the beginning of their movies. Even a film like Die Hard, which one might describe as “terrorists take over a skyscraper in Los Angeles, and only Bruce Willis can save the day” is much more. It’s actually the story of a husband trying desperately to get back to his wife and save their marriage. He flies across the country to visit her for Christmas and convince her to return to New York and their former life together, but terrorists interrupt the reunion, forcing Willis’s character, John McClane, to fight a lot harder to get his wife back.

**Backpacks**
> A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing the audience’s anticipation about a coming event. It’s when a storyteller loads up the audience with all the storyteller’s hopes and fears in that moment before moving the story forward. It’s an attempt to do two things:
> 1.  Make the audience wonder what will happen next.
> 2.  Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the moment about to be described

>This is why heist movies like the Ocean’s Eleven franchise explain almost every part of the robbers’ plan before they ever make a move. If you understand their plan to rob the casino, you can experience the same level of frustration, worry, fear, and suspense that the characters feel when their plans go awry. The filmmakers put the audience on Danny Ocean’s team. They know the plan, so they feel as if they are a part of the heist themselves.

>Backpacks are most effective when a plan does not work. If I had described my plan for begging for gas, and then the plan worked perfectly, there would have been no payoff for the Backpack. The scene would fall flat. If I go through all the trouble of explaining my plan beforehand, and then I say, “The kid agrees to lend me the gas,” the audience is oddly unsatisfied. They are left wondering why I went through all of that explanation only to find out that things turned out fine.

>It’s an odd thing: The audience wants characters (or storytellers) to succeed, but they don’t really want characters to succeed. It’s struggle and strife that make stories great. They want to see their characters ultimately triumph, but they want suffering first. They don’t want anything to be easy. Perfect plans executed perfectly never make good stories. They are the stories told by narcissists, jackasses, and thin-skinned egotists.

**Breadcrumbs**
>Storytellers use Breadcrumbs when we hint at a future event but only reveal enough to keep the audience guessing.

>Stakes. The audience needs to hear the next sentence. 

>The trick is to choose the Breadcrumbs that create the most wonder in the minds of your audience without giving them enough to guess correctly. Choose wisely. Breadcrumbs are particularly effective when the truly unexpected is coming.

**Hourglasses**
> There comes a time in many stories when you reached a moment (or the moment) that the audience has been waiting for. Perhaps you have paved the way to the moment with Breadcrumbs and Backpacks, or maybe you’ve used none of these strategies because you’ve got yourself a stake-laden story, and now you’re approaching the payoff. The sentence you’ve been waiting to say. The sentence your audience has been waiting to hear. This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It’s time to slow things down. Grind them to a halt when possible. When you know the audience is hanging on your every word, let them hang. Drag out the wait as long as possible

> In addition to adding in superfluous detail and summary, I’ll slow my pace as I approach this sentence. I will reduce my volume. I want the audience on the edge of their seats, desperately awaiting those twelve words.

> Stakes. The desire of an audience to hear the next sentence, made greater by the deliberate slowing down of action and pace.

**Crystal Balls**
> The Crystal Ball is the easiest of the strategies to deploy, because you already use Crystal Balls in everyday life. A Crystal Ball is a false prediction made by a storyteller to cause the audience to wonder if the prediction will prove to be true.
> 
> We use Crystal Balls in everyday life because we, as human beings, are all prediction machines. We are constantly trying to anticipate the future, so when telling stories, recounting those in-the-moment predictions is critical. 
> 
> You might tell your significant other, “The boss called me into her office this morning, and as I walked down the hall, I just knew I had done something wrong and was getting fired. This was it. The end of the road for me. It was the longest walk of my life. When I stepped into her office, she told me that I was being promoted.” Or “I was sure that my boyfriend forgot my birthday again, but when I got home, he had a surprise party waiting for me.” Or “For the first four decades of my life, I thought brie was disgusting simply because of the way it looked. But tonight I tried brie for the first time, and I can’t believe what I’ve been missing.”
> 
> Remember, the best way to ensure that your story has stakes is to choose a story that has stakes. Elephants, Backpacks, Breadcrumbs, Hourglasses, and Crystal Balls will only get you so far. If your story is boring, it will always be boring. But if your story has some potentially boring parts — sections that need to be told but simply aren’t compelling — these strategies will help a lot. 

> Every single one of the stories I have told onstage has an Elephant. They all begin with a clear sense of the want or need or peril or problem of mystery. Sometimes the Elephant changes color, sometimes not. 

> If you’re not sure about the level of stakes in your story, simply ask yourself:  
> •   Would the audience want to hear my next sentence?
> •   If I stopped speaking right now, would anyone care?
> •   Am I more compelling than video games and pizza and sex at this moment? 

> If the answer to any of these questions is no, you need to raise the stakes. Use these strategies to engage your audience and bring them to the edge of their seat.

> One more strategy to keep your audiences attention is Humor. Humor doesn’t actually add to or raise the stakes of a story. It doesn’t give your audience a reason to listen for the next sentence. It doesn’t increase the level of suspense or peril or mystery. But it’s a way of keeping your audience’s attention through a section of your story that you think might be less than compelling.

> Humor will keep your audience listening, but use it for this reason only when you’re unable to raise the stakes in any other way. Stakes are essential in a story. Stakes are the gears that make stories work. If your story lacks stakes or lacks meaningful stakes, there is nothing you can do to make that story great. Humor is optional. Stakes are nonnegotiable.
