The theories of intelligence have a significant impact on how individuals approach excellence in their field (as mentioned in [[Success and failure in different fields can be heavily influenced by an individual's theory of intelligence]]). This is best illustrated through the metaphor of a hermit crab. Just like the crab must leave its shell and face vulnerability in order to find a larger, more fitting shell, individuals must embrace a long-term, organic learning process instead of sticking to static, safe mediocrity. The pursuit of excellence often involves overcoming discomfort, adapting to new situations, and learning from experiences.

> So how does this affect us in our day-to-day lives? Fundamentally. The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually, growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety. The hermit crab is a colorful example of a creature that lives by this aspect of the growth process (albeit without our psychological baggage). As the crab gets bigger, it needs to find a more spacious shell. So the slow, lumbering creature goes on a quest for a new home. If an appropriate new shell is not found quickly, a terribly delicate moment of truth arises. A soft creature that is used to protection of built-in armor must now go out into the world, exposed to predators in all its mushy vulnerability. That learning phase between shells is where our growth can spring from. Someone stuck with an entity theory of intelligence is like an anorexic hermit crab, starving itself so it doesn't grow to have to find a new shell. â€“ Josh Waitzkin
