In [[The bulletproof problem solving framework]], the most important step is to disaggregate the problem in a logical way into component parts. In this way, you can isolate the most important analyses. Logic Trees are the primary work tool for this task since they make it easy to see the structure of the problem, are holistic in that everything relevant is captured in the tree, and lead to clear hypotheses that can be tested.

> We learned the power of logic trees at McKinsey and continue to find them essential to good problem solving. Why? Because they do the following: 
	- Provide a clear visual representation of the problem so that everyone can understand the component parts. 
	- Done correctly, they are holistic in the sense that everything relevant is captured in the tree.
	- Lead to clear hypotheses that can be tested with data and analysis.
