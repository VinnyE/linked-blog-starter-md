**Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on Performance**
Our cognitive biases can lead us to reject situations we should accept, and overreach for outcomes that are beyond our grasp. This can trigger a downward spiral, causing us to make further mistakes. High performers, however, have the ability to recognize these biases and integrate this awareness into their intuitive decision-making processes. This allows them to navigate complex situations more effectively and maintain a high level of performance even under pressure.
