title: "Strengthen your circle of competence with key practices"

The circle of competence (see: [[remote-blog/publish/Circle of competence]]) can be developed and maintained through years of experience, learning from mistakes, and actively seeking better methods of practice and thought. We must [[Continuously update maps and models for accuracy]]. Curiosity, monitoring, and feedback are key practices that contribute to building and maintaining a circle of competence. By learning from the experiences of others, we can more effectively expand our knowledge and expertise. Honest self-reporting and keeping a record of our performance (ex: keeping a decision journal) is essential for self-improvement and overcoming ego/overconfidence.

Journaling is an effective way to track our performance, as it allows us to step back from automatic thinking and analyze our successes and failures. It is important to seek external feedback as well, as it provides valuable insights that can help refine our circle of competence.

> There is no shortcut to understanding. Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought.

> There are three key practices needed in order to build and maintain a circle of competence: curiosity and a desire to learn, monitoring, and feedback. 

> Learning comes when experience meets reflection. You can learn from your own experiences. Or you can learn from the experience of others, through books, articles, and conversations. Learning everything on your own is costly and slow. You are one person. Learning from the experiences of others is much more productive. You need to always approach your circle with curiosity, seeking out information that can help you expand and strengthen it.

> Second, you need to monitor your track record in areas which you have, or want to have, a circle of competence. And you need to have the courage to monitor honestly so the feedback can be used to your advantage. The reason we have such difficulty with overconfidence—as demonstrated in studies which show that most of us are much worse drivers, lovers, managers, traders (and many other things) than we think we are—is because we have a problem with honest self-reporting. We don’t keep the right records, because we don’t really want to know what we’re good and bad at. Ego is a powerful enemy when it comes to better understanding reality
> 
> Keeping a journal of your own performance is the easiest and most private way to give self-feedback. Journals allow you to step out of your automatic thinking and ask yourself: What went wrong? How could I do better? Monitoring your own performance allows you to see patterns that you simply couldn’t see before. This type of analysis is painful for the ego, which is also why it helps build a circle of competence. You can’t improve if you don’t know what you’re doing wrong.

> Finally, you must occasionally solicit external feedback. This helps build a circle, but is also critical for maintaining one.
