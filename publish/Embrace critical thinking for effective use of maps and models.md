title: "Embrace critical thinking for effective use of maps and models"

To use maps and models accurately, we should consider three key aspects: reality as the ultimate update (see: [[Continuously update maps and models for accuracy]]), the subjectivity of the cartographer, and the potential for maps to influence territories. By embracing critical thinking and recognizing the limitations of maps and models (see: [[Maps and models simplify complexity with inherent limitations]]), we can make better decisions and more effectively navigate the ever-changing landscape of reality. It's essential not to assume that maps or models provide an objective view but rather to consider them in the context they were created. We must be cautious about attempting to force reality to conform to a model, as this can result in unintended consequences. [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]].

>  In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take three important considerations into account: Reality is the ultimate update. Consider the cartographer. Maps can influence territories

> We then should not assume that our literal maps depict an objective view of the geographical territory. For example, historians have shown that the modern borders of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq reflect British and French determination to maintain influence in the Middle East after World War I.10 Thus, they are a better map of Western interest than of local custom and organization. Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created.

> Consider the cartographer: Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators. We can see this in the changing national boundaries that make up our world maps. Countries come and go depending on shifting political and cultural sensibilities. When we look at the world map we have today, we tend to associate societies with nations, assuming that the borders reflect a common identity shared by everyone contained within them

> Maps can influence territories: This problem was part of the central argument put forth by Jane Jacobs in her groundbreaking work, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. She chronicled the efforts of city planners who came up with elaborate models for the design and organization of cities without paying any attention to how cities actually work. They then tried to fit the cities into the model. She describes how cities were changed to correspond to these models, and the often negative consequences of these efforts. “It became possible also to map out master plans for the statistical city, and people take these more seriously, for we are all accustomed to believe that maps and reality are necessarily related, or that if they are not, we can make them so by altering reality.”
