The decision-making process often involves trying to maximize [[Expected utility]], essentially imagining alternative futures and assessing our potential well-being. However, this approach, although seemingly rational, often falls short when dealing with significant life choices, as they often lead to Wild problems. [[Wild problems are the significant, life-altering decisions we encounter, where the outcomes are unclear, and each choice can significantly influence our identity and future]].
