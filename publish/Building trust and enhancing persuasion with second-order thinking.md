Applying [[Second-order thinking]] to our relationships can foster trust and cooperation, as [focusing on win-win interactions generates long-term benefits](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1655226056394039301). This approach also helps us avoid short-term gains that may cause problems down the line, thereby saving time and effort in the future. After all, [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]. 

When constructing arguments, demonstrating an understanding of second-order effects makes our claims more persuasive, as it shows that we have considered the broader implications of our stance.

> Developing trust for future success: Trust and trustworthiness are the results of multiple interactions. This is why second-order thinking is so useful and valuable. Going for the immediate payoff in our interactions with people, unless they are a win-win, almost always guarantees that interaction will be a one-off. Maximizing benefits is something that happens over time. Thus, considering the effects of the effects of our actions on others, or on our reputations, is critical to getting people to trust us, and to enjoy the benefits of cooperation that come with that.
