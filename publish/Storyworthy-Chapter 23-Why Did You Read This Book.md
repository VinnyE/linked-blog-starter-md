In the era of truncated, digitized communication, the ability to speak engagingly and entertainingly is a veritable superpower, a skill so rare yet valuable it's preferred over technical ability in some workplaces. We learn better when we're entertained, which is why great teachers hook their students with something engaging, often storytelling, making learning an intimate human connection. Storytelling allows the speaker to demonstrate authenticity, vulnerability, and humanity, building trust and connection with the audience. This compelling and honest form of communication can even create safe spaces for individuals to share their own personal, secret stories. In essence, good storytelling can become a transformative experience, offering new perspectives, boosting self-esteem, and bringing warmth and wholeness to the listeners' lives.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Power of Engaging Communication
In an increasingly digital world, the ability to communicate engagingly and entertainingly is an uncommon and prized skill. It is so influential that in some professional environments, it is preferred over pure technical competence. A speaker who can captivate an audience holds a rare power in today's world.

### The Role of Entertainment in Learning
Entertaining presentations can significantly enhance the learning process. Whether you're a teacher, presenter, coach, or salesperson, engaging your audience effectively means they learn better, understand more, and stay interested. It is a powerful method for conveying information more effectively.

### Storytelling as a Teaching Tool
Beyond entertainment, storytelling is a profoundly effective teaching tool. It's a way to establish trust, demonstrate authenticity and vulnerability, and form a human connection. Storytelling is not merely about keeping students' attention; it's about opening your heart to them and fostering a shared bond.

### The Transformative Power of Storytelling
Storytelling isn't just for teaching facts or entertaining; it can create a safe space for people to share their own personal experiences. By bravely sharing their own stories, storytellers can make their listeners feel secure enough to unburden themselves. This transformative process can help individuals see the world in a new light, feel better about themselves, and feel connected to others in a meaningful way.

> In his memoir Tough Shit, filmmaker Kevin Smith writes that anytime a person is speaking to a group of people, in any context, the speaker has a duty and an obligation to be entertaining. I couldn’t agree more. It’s the purpose of this book. Or at least one of them.
> 
> I like to think about storytelling in terms of superheroes, because I believe that a person who can speak in an entertaining and engaging way to a group of people possesses a superpower that is sorely lacking in the world today. As people’s gazes continue to fall to their screens and communication is truncated into bite-size text messages, the human beings who can still hold the attention of an audience and teach and speak in an entertaining way possess enormous power.

> In 2015, I spent some time in Brazil consulting with an engineering firm. The CEO of the company told me that he would rather hire poorly trained engineers who can speak to potential clients, meet with government agencies, and pitch projects to large groups of people than highly skilled engineers who lack these communication skills. Why? “I can teach a bad engineer to be a good engineer. But I have no idea how to turn a person who can’t write or speak well into someone who can. I’m not sure if it’s even possible.”
> 
> It's possible; unfortunately, it takes longer than the afternoon I was spending with this man. But think about that: bad engineers who can speak well will be hired over good engineers who cannot. That is a superpower.

> When you are entertaining, people learn better. You convey information more effectively. You will become a better teacher, presenter, coach, salesperson, trainer, CEO, professor, parent, and dinner companion.

> When a student-teacher presents me with a lesson that he or she would like to teach to my class, my first question is always this: “What’s the hook? What is the reason for my students to listen and pay attention to you?”
> 
> This is why every lesson requires a hook. A hook is not a statement like “This material will be on Friday’s test” or “This is something you’ll use for the rest of your life.” A hook is an attempt to be entertaining, engaging, thought-provoking, surprising, challenging, daring, and even shocking. This can be in dozens of ways. Most importantly, a teacher can use storytelling. Not only is storytelling an entertaining way to engage and entertain students, but it opens your heart to your students. It demonstrates your humanity, your authenticity, and your vulnerability. It's a way to establish trust and faith with your students. It connects you to them. When your students love you, they will learn, even if they despise the subject.

> Here is something crazy. Perhaps the craziest thing that has ever happened to me through storytelling: Four times I have stepped off the stage at a storytelling show and been approached by a woman who wanted to share the story of her miscarriage with me. Four times. In all four instances, the woman’s miscarriage was a secret. She had told no one that she was pregnant, and no one knew that she had miscarried. She told me first. I was speechless the first time this happened. I called Elysha immediately after the show to tell her. Elysha’s response was surprising. “Of course she wanted to tell you,” she said. “You stood on that stage and talked about one of your most difficult moments in your life with complete honesty. Your story made you safe to talk to. And she never needs to see you again. She could unburden herself of this secret to someone she knew she could trust, and she doesn’t have to see you at work or home the next day.” It made sense.
