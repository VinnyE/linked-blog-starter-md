In the journey of storytelling, we begin at the end - we know the key (5-second) moment and its implications, it's the backbone of our narrative. To breathe life into this narrative, we identify the opposite of this key moment - this serves as our starting point, and the journey between these polarities showcases our transformation. Regardless of the nature and magnitude, change is the essence of a compelling story. A story is no stagnant lake; it's a fast-flowing river, challenging the listener to keep pace. Hence, to keep our story navigable, we distill it to its essence, eliminating redundant details. We design our stories like a thrilling heist, compressing time, intensifying emotions, and simplifying narratives. We start with forward movement, instantly hooking our audience into our world, avoiding premature expectations that might curb their experience. The craft of storytelling is about navigating time and transformation, starting from the end, and culminating in an emotionally resonant realization.

## Concept Breakdown

### Beginning with the End
In storytelling, we begin crafting our narrative with the final, decisive moment in mind. This understanding of the end informs all choices made in constructing the story and helps to decide which combination of action, dialogue, and description best serves to capture the moment.

### The Story's Arc: Opposites Attract
The starting point of a story should ideally be the polar opposite of the ending. This contrast creates an arc or a journey of change and transformation in the story that keeps the audience engaged. The narrative thread moves from one state to another, reflecting a shift in thought, feeling, or condition.

### Change: The Lifeblood of Storytelling
A story must depict some form of change - it may not always be positive or monumental, but it is indispensable. The most riveting stories are those of incremental growth, tiny steps forward, and even failures. Regardless of the extent and direction of the change, it is the pivot around which a story revolves.

### Streamlining Stories: The River Analogy
An oral story is like a river, a ceaseless flow of words. To make this narrative journey less overwhelming for the listener, storytellers distill the story to its essence. By pruning away unnecessary details and starting as close to the end as possible, the story becomes simpler, clearer, and easier to follow.

### Building Momentum: The Forward Movement
A story should ideally commence with a forward motion, creating an immediate sense of momentum and engagement. It gives the audience a feeling of being drawn into a world that's already in motion, increasing their investment in the story from the get-go.

### Setting Expectations: The Pitfall
Setting up expectations or providing a 'thesis statement' at the beginning of a story can hamper the audience's experience. It potentially sets unrealistic standards, reduces chances of surprise, and may not immediately engage the audience in the story's time and place. Hence, it's advisable to dive directly into the narrative.

> But when telling true stories about our lives, we always start with the ending, because we’re not making stuff up. We’re not hoping to invent the perfect combination of action, description, and dialogue. We’re telling the truth, so even if we’re not entirely sure of how to tell our ending — which combination of action, dialogue, and description will best capture that five-second moment — we know what happened. We know the who, what, where, and when, and we probably know the why (though that can sometimes come later). We know what our five-second moment is, and therefore that is where we begin the process of crafting our story. We start at the end. 

> This is a beautiful thing, because knowing the ending will inform all the choices that we must make as we craft the rest of the story. Everything must serve our five-second moment, so knowing the ending — and starting the process of crafting the story with the ending — is helpful beyond measure. In fact the ending simply involves the choice of words you will use. How will you describe your five-second moment for the greatest emotional effect? The hard part is finding the beginning, because it involves choosing the right moments from your life, and there is often a multitude of choices. So how do you choose the right place to start a story? Simple. Ask yourself where your story ends. What is the meaning of your five-second moment? Say it aloud.

> Once you’ve distilled your five-second moment down to its essence, ask yourself: What is the opposite of your five-second moment? Simply put, the beginning of the story should be the opposite of the end. Find the opposite of your transformation, revelation, or realization, and this is where your story should start. This is what creates an arc in your story. This is how a story shows change over time.         I was once this, but now I am this.         I once thought this, but now I think this.         I once felt this, but now I feel this. 

> Stories must reflect change of some kind. It need not always be positive change, and the change need not be monumental. In fact, stories about failure, embarrassment, and shame are fantastic. Stories about trying desperately to achieve a goal and failing spectacularly are beloved. Even when progress is made, the best stories often reflect incremental change. Tiny steps forward. Glacial improvement. Audiences would much rather hear about incremental, tenuous growth than about overnight success. Regardless of whether your change is infinitesimal or profound, positive or negative, your story must reflect change. You must begin and end your story in entirely different states of being. Change is key.

> You create the arc of a story through the change that your story ultimately describes.

> This change is what makes stories satisfying. It's how storytellers are able to movie an audience emotionally. The same holds true for most movies. Simply ask yourself what the opposite of the first fifteen minutes of a movie is, and you will almost always have your ending.

> But this is the magic of storytelling. Even when the ending is all but certain, a good storyteller can grab the audience by the throat and make them temporarily forget that they know damn well how this movie will end

> When we search our past for the beginnings of our stories — which storytellers do quite often — we have a mountain of material from which to choose. Less effective storytellers latch onto the first thing that comes to mind rather than making a list of anecdotes, analyzing them for content, tone, the potential for humor, and connectivity to the story before deciding. I also believe that great storytellers know this: The first idea is rarely the best idea. It may be the most convenient idea. The easiest to remember. The one you personally like the most. But rarely is the first idea the one that I choose. First ideas are for the lazy. The complacent. The easily satisfied.

> I also try to start my story as close to the end as possible (a rule Kurt Vonnegut followed when writing short stories). I want my stories to be as temporally limited as possible. I strive for simplicity at all times. By starting as close to the end as possible, we shorten our stories. We avoid unnecessary setup. We eliminate superfluous details.

> Simplifying also helps storytellers tell their stories better. When time and space is limited, it’s easier to remember your story. Easier to master your transitions, and easier to remember those favorite lines that you don’t want to forget. But simplification is even more important because of the difference between oral storytelling and written storytelling. A written story is like a lake. Readers can step in and out of the water at their leisure, and the water always remains the same. This stillness and permanence allow for pausing, rereading, contemplation, and the use of outside sources to help with meaning. It also allows the reader to control the speed at which the story is received. An oral story is like a river. It is a constantly flowing torrent of words. When listeners need to step outside of the river to ponder a detail, wonder about something that confuses them, or attempt to make meaning, the river continues to flow. When the listener finally steps back into the river, he or she is behind. The water that has flowed by will never be seen again, and as a result, the listener is constantly chasing the story, trying to catch up.

> Movies operate similarly. Think about Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven franchise. In each of these movies, a group of likable thieves gather in Las Vegas to rob a world-class casino of hundreds of millions of dollars. In the real world, a heist like this would take months or even years to plan, but that would never make a satisfying story. Instead, Soderbergh has these professional thieves plan their caper over the course of a few days. This is a ridiculous way to plan a robbery. But compressing the action into smaller amount of time makes the story more exciting. It intensifies the action and emotion. It increases the likelihood of problems. It also simplifies the story.

> Here are a couple more practical tips for choosing an opening: 
> 1. Try to start your story with forward movement whenever possible. Establish yourself as a person who is physically moving through space. Opening with forward movement creates instant momentum in a story. It makes the audience feel that we’re already on our way, immersed in the world you are moving us through. We’re going somewhere important.
>    2. 2. Don’t start by setting expectations. Listen to people in the world tell you stories. Often they start with a sentence like, “This is hilarious,” or “You need to hear this,” or “You’re not going to believe this.” This is always a mistake, for three reasons.
	1. First, It establishes potentially unrealistic expectations. "Hilarious" is an exceptionally high bar. 
	2. Second, starting your your story with a thesis statement reduces your chances of surprising your audience. When you tell me that the story is hilarious, I'm already primed for humor.
	3. Third, these are simply not interesting ways to start a story. A thesis statement, prediction about the audience's response to the story, or a summary of its theme or mood does not immediately draw us into the story's time and place. We don't feel transported to a new interesting locale. We don't get the sense that we are traveling back in time. We feel lectured to. We feel cheated. Start with the story, not with a summary of the story. 

> Many movies open with simple overhead views passing over an ocean, a cityscape, or a mountain pass. Many movies based in New York City open with an overhead approach of the island over water. This has nothing to do with the film but allows the director to open with momentum. Forward movement. We're headed somewhere important.
