### Chapter Four Build a Great Workplan and Team Processes
- [[One-day answer]]
- The workplan is the place to get specific about your initial hypotheses, clarify what outputs you want from analysis, and assign the parts so that everyone knows what they are doing and by when.
- Having fun instead of drudgery in problem solving means finding the critical path. The critical path is the continuation of the prioritization process we described toward the end of Chapter 3. It means high‐grading the analysis you use to solve problems so that you are always working on the parts that have the highest probability of yielding insight. Workplanning and the frequent iterations that follow the initial plan are the way you stay on that critical path. 
- Knock‐out analysis involves making estimates of the importance of a variable and the influence you can have on it, an estimate of expected value, the first cut of which comes out of our prioritization matrix from Chapter 3. 
-  Best-practice approaches to work planning:
    - We don’t do any analyses that aren’t guided by very clear and testable hypotheses.  We never go off and build a model without a very good idea about what question it answers. There is no vague “I’ll look into X or Y.”
    - We sharpen our thinking even more by requiring that we can visualize what form the output might take (we call this dummying the chart), so we know if we would want it if we had it.
    - We are very careful about the order in which we do analyses. Do knock-out analyses first.
    - We are very specific about who is doing what by when.  No confusion about responsibilities for deadlines.
    - We have workplans to go out only 2-3 weeks, and longer-term study plans to rough out later periods.
- Follow pareto principle. 20% of the problem that yields 80% of the result. 
- What is it that good problem-solving teams do better in their approach to work-planning and analysis?
    - They are hypothesis driven and end-product oriented.
    - They porpoise frequently between the hypothesis and data. They are flexible in the face of new data.
    - They look for breakthrough thinking rather than incremental improvements.
- The four most important biases:
    - Confirmation bias: Confirmation bias is falling in love with your one-day answer.
    - Anchoring bias: Anchoring bias is the mistaken mental attachment to an initial data range or data pattern that colors your subsequent understanding of the problem.
    - Loss aversion: Loss aversion, and its relatives, the sunk cost fallacy, book loss fear, and the endowment effect, are a failure to ignore costs already spent (sunk) or any asymmetric valuing of losses and gains.
    - Availability bias: Availability bias is the use of an existing mental map because it is readily at hand, rather than developing a new model for a new problem, or just being influenced by more recent facts or events.
    - Over-optimism: Over-optimism comes in several forms including overconfidence, illusion of control or simply failure to contemplate disaster outcomes.
    
*Chapter also talks about team brainstorming practices, how to reduce bias, etc. But overall not my favorite chapter, not very actionable for me. Started to lose interest at this point.* 

### Chapter Five Conduct Analyses
- Good problem solvers have a toolkit at their disposal that helps them work efficiently, starting with heuristics and rules of thumb to understand the direction and magnitudes of relationships that allows them to focus attention on the most important issues. They don't jump right into building giant models until they have a clear understanding of whether and where complex tools are required. ^b22a99
- Heuristics are powerful tools that act as shortcuts in analysis. They help you size the different elements of the problem to determine the efficient path in further analysis.
- They can be dangerous when incorrectly applied, of course. Author Nicholas Taleb describes how simple rules based on past success can lead you astray in settings where low probability events can produce outsized errors. (see: [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]] and [[Understanding trends and laws in human history]])
- The Sherlock Holmes approach of painting a picture of the problem by asking who, what, where, when, how, and why is a powerful root-cause tool to quickly focus problem-solving. Ask “Why? five times. (see: [[The five whys]])

### Chapter Six Big Guns of Analysis
- This chapter talks about "the big guns" of analysis. Monte Carlo simulation, machine learning, regression analysis, game theory, etc. 

*Not a relevant chapter for me. Basically skipped through without notes*

### Chapter Seven Synthesize Results and Tell a Great Story
- Done right, your conclusions are an engaging story, supported with facts, analyses, and arguments that convince your audience of the merits of your recommended path.
- Structuring your arguments: Argument structure vs Grouping structure
- Sometimes it is best to carefully lead the audience from situation to observation to resolution, which are your recommended actions. But our bias in most circumstances is to lead by answering the question “What Should I Do?” and then summarize the situation and key observations that support action.

### Chapter 8 Problem Solving with Long Time Frames and High Uncertainty
- Uncertainty can be a good thing for strategic problem solvers! Hedge fund and other clever investors hope for uncertain and volatile markets—provided they have an analytic edge. If your problem solving is right you can earn good returns and guard your downside while others are floundering.  ^9405ee
- 5 Levels of uncertainty (Reasonably predictable futures, alternative futures, a range of futures, true ambiguity- impossible to predict, unexpected or unforeseen conditions)
- Where uncertainty sits at level 2 or greater, most decision makers will seek to defer irreversible commitments. That can work in the absence of competition but becomes a more difficult equation where there is the possibility of preemption. Big bets are open only to a few, as Hugh Courtney pointed out—those with business models that generate a lot of cash and have low debt
- What can you do to address uncertainty?
	- Do nothing/buy time
	- Buy information
	- Buy hedges
		- Ex: fossil fuel company investing in renewable energy
	- Buy insurance
	- Buy low-cost options
		- How IBM lost the PC business is put down to a failure to exercise the low‐cost options it held in its key suppliers. “Early on IBM had the financial resources to take a large equity position in both Intel and Microsoft. It did make an investment in Intel in 1982, getting a 20% equity stake and warrants to purchase another 10%. But, ironically, IBM sold out in 1986 and 1987 for $625 million. Ten years later that 20% stake would have been worth $25 billion. As for Microsoft, IBM had an opportunity to buy 30% of Microsoft for under $300 million in mid‐1986. By the end of 1996 that $300 million investment would have been worth $33 billion.
	- No regret moves
	- Big bets
		- The Big Short book and film, describing the investments in shorting subprime mortgage credit default swaps in the US, is a great example of a big bet when uncertainty remained high.

### Chapter 9 Wicked Problems
- [[Wicked problems]]
- A large‐ scale study of obesity in the United States noted the increase in the obesity rate from 23 to 31% over a 32‐year period. Their conclusion was dramatic: “Obesity may spread in social networks in a quantifiable and discernible pattern that depends on the nature of social ties.” Their findings were that if one person became obese the likelihood of a spouse becoming obese was 37% higher, 40% for siblings, and 57% for friends.

### Chapter 10 Becoming a Great Problem Solver
- Great problem solving consists of good questions that become sharp hypotheses, a logical approach to framing and disaggregating issues, strict prioritization to save time, solid team processes to foster creativity and fight bias, smart analytics that start with heuristics and move to the right big guns, and finally a commitment to synthesize findings and turn them into a story that galvanizes action.
- 10 points to keep in mind:
	- Take the time up front to really understand your problem
	- Get started with nothing more than a problem statement
	- Try several cuts at the tree
	- Use a team wherever you can
	- Make the right investment in a good workplan
	- Start your analysis with summary statistics, heuristics, and rules of thumb to get a feel for the data and solution space
	- Don't be afraid to employ big analytic guns when required
	- Put as much effort into synthesis and telling the story as doing the analysis
	- Treat the seven-steps process like an accordion
	- Don't be intimidated by any problem you face
