title: "The difference between necessary and sufficient conditions for success"

Often, we tend to assume that fulfilling the necessary conditions for a particular goal or outcome means we have satisfied all the sufficient conditions needed for its achievement. However, this is not always the case. The distinction between the two is crucial to understanding the unpredictable nature of success (see: [[The role of unpredictable factors in success]]). The set of necessary conditions to achieve success is only a subset of the larger set of sufficient conditions required for the same. The sufficient set is much larger and more complex than the necessary set, containing variables that are often beyond our control or prediction. The more we can [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]], the better we can picture the variables involved in the sufficient set.

> We often make the mistake of assuming that having some necessary conditions in place means that we have all of the sufficient conditions in place for our desired event or effect to occur. The gap between the two is the difference between becoming a published author and becoming J.K. Rowling. Certainly you have to know how to write well to become either, but it isn’t sufficient to become a Rowling. This is somewhat obvious to most. What’s not obvious is that the gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control. Assume you wanted to make it into the Fortune 500. Capital is necessary, but not sufficient. Hard work is necessary, but not sufficient. Intelligence is necessary, but not sufficient. Billionaire success takes all of those things and more, plus a lot of luck. That’s a big reason that there’s no recipe.

 > In mathematics they call these sets. The set of conditions necessary to become successful is a part of the set that is sufficient to become successful. But the sufficient set itself is far larger than the necessary set. Without that distinction, it’s too easy for us to be misled by the wrong stories.
