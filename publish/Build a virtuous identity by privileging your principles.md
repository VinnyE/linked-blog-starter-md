title: "Build a virtuous identity by privileging your principles"

Ethical dilemmas are an ongoing tension between our immediate desires and our higher principles. When making choices, we must avoid narrowly defining 'rationality' as choosing the most personally advantageous option. Instead, we should uphold our principles, even when doing so comes at a cost. This act of putting our principles first shapes who we are and who we aspire to become. Not everything should be a trade-off—especially not our sense of self. Over time, consistent practice and adherence to our principles can help us transform, shifting our desires towards the virtues we aspire to embody. Moreover, the principle of 'feeding the good dog' suggests that we can shape our character by regularly choosing actions that align with our principles. It's about recognizing and embracing the dynamic nature of our desires, and using this to cultivate virtuous habits and behaviors.

> Ethical dilemmas are wild problems where the tension between the pig and the philosopher is front and center. What feels good in the moment has consequences that can compromise our sense of self and cost us in ways that persist over time. Narrow utilitarianism is often in tension with some higher principle related to flourishing.

> The economist Ariel Rubinstein defines a rational decision: The person asks, What is desirable? The person asks, What is feasible? The person chooses the most desirable from among the feasible alternatives. The standard critique of this model of human behavior is that we are flawed calculators–we act inconsistently; we are fooled by uncertainty; we have biases. This is the world of behavior economics. But the deeper problem is that if we're not careful, when we think of what is desirable, we will think about the pool and the margarita and not so much about flourishing. 

> This is surely the narrowest form of utilitarianism and unfortunately some economists encourage such thinking in the teaching of economics and in their research. They confuse what we want to do in our narrow self-interest with what we ought to do. They are not the same thing.

> It is certainly the case that people struggle to live up to their principles when keeping those principles is expensive. One of my favorite summaries of this idea is the expression "where you stand depends on where you sit." Another version was uttered, if not originated, by Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." If you are self-aware, you realize that monetary and nonmonetary rewards and punishments do exert pressure on you to behave in certain ways. Economists exploit this reality when designing incentive structures–subsidies and taxes for example–that encourage or discourage certain kinds of behavior.

> In my experience, when you suggest people that they respond to incentives, which is another way of saying that they take trade-offs into account when making choices, they get very angry. They don't like the idea that they can be bought by a subsidy or a big enough payoff. Most people will indeed buy more of something when the price is lowered or less of something when it gets more expensive. So why are they offended?
> 
> They’re offended because they like to think that their principles, their core values, are not for sale. We are more than calculating machines that recalibrate when the prices change. Yes, real human beings will sacrifice their principles if the price is right. But the anger that people feel when confronted with the possibility that such an insight might apply to them is understandable. We don’t like to think that our virtue has a price. Of course sometimes it does. Sometimes we sell ourselves, and cheaply. But that’s a flaw, not a virtue to be praised merely because it seems to be rational.

> When it comes to decisions when your essence is on the line, don’t consider the cost. Save your sense of self. Return the diamond, no matter how large. No trade-offs. Rationality, narrowly defined, says consider the cost. Teodora’s teaching is simpler. Do the right thing. Return the diamond. Don’t consider the cost of returning the diamond, the things you might have enjoyed with the money if you sold it.

> Nothing cancels out betraying who you are or who you aspire to be. So you can’t add “losing respect for myself” as one of the costs of keeping the diamond. Well, you can, but it’s silly because it’s the one factor that nothing else cancels out. 

> The rule is simple: Privilege your principles. Your decisions define who you are. Don’t make trade-offs when it comes to your essence. Live with integrity. Do the right thing and respect yourself. That at least should be the starting place. 

> Putting your principles above the day-to-day costs and benefits is about more than ethics or the virtue of honesty that we confront when we find a lost wallet or are offered a consulting opportunity that is highly lucrative but ethically questionable. Privileging your principles is about what kind of person you want to be and who you might want to become. It’s about visiting a friend in the hospital when it feels like you have better things to do. It’s about listening to that friend who needs to share something even though you’re in a hurry to run an errand that you’re itching to finish. It’s about voting when you’re dreading the wait in line. 

> There are two virtues of putting your principles—whatever you feel defines who you really are—above narrower costs and benefits from your decisions. The first is the virtue of simplicity. Having a rule that you always put your principles above the narrower costs and benefits means you spend less time deliberating and suffering. You have a rule. You try to follow the rule. You may struggle to follow the rule, but the rule is the default. So in principle, you don’t agonize over whether following the rule is too costly or not in this particular case. You just follow the rule. rules are nice because they reduce time deliberating and trying to measure those pesky, hard-to-measure costs and benefits. But rules have a much more important advantage over what seems to be the rational approach of going case by case and trying to calculate and weigh the costs and benefits more thoroughly. Rules prevent us from fooling ourselves. When narrow utilitarianism conflicts with flourishing, remember that the pool is what you know and the pool is seductive. Work hard to remember what your principles are and privilege them—put them first unless you have a strong reason not to. 

> What is the lesson? George Hell is the moral equivalent of a vampire. He wants to become an anti-vampire, George Heaven. He desires to have different desires than he once had. How is that possible? The answer is practice. Through love and changed behavior, Hell does more than change who he appears to be. He changes who he actually is. To get to where he wants to go, he wears the mask. We generally don't like hypocrisy–the betrayal of principle–but Beerbohm casts it as a virtue. By pretending to be good and going through the motions, George Hell transforms himself. He repairs his hypocrisy, not by removing the mask but by removing his flaws. The mask forces George Hell to go against his narrow utilitarian self, to live up to who he aspires to be. 

>  Frank Knight wrote, “Insofar as man is wise or good, his ‘character’ is acquired chiefly by posing as better than he is, until a part of his pretense becomes a habit.”
>
> Practice may not make perfect, but done correctly it should lead to better. So practice at what you want to become. You can change your preferences. What once appealed to you can become unappealing. What you once found unappealing can potentially give you pleasure if you try it and persist at it. Goodness is an acquired taste. And habits are exactly that, habits. If you come to enjoy being generous, honest, less self-centered, the habit becomes self-enforcing, as Frank Knight suggested. 

> The seventeenth-century French writer La Rochefoucauld wrote, “Virtues are swallowed up by self-interest as rivers are lost in the sea.” The philosopher and economist Dan Klein argues that what La Rochefoucauld meant was that there is a way to make practicing a virtue self-interested.

> There is a much-repeated story on the internet, usually told by a Native American elder. Here is Eliot Rosen's version from his book Experiencing the soul: A Native American Elder once described his own inner struggles in this manner: “Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The other dog is good. The mean dog fights the good dog all the time.” When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied, “The one I feed the most.”
> 
> In most areas of life, especially the important ones, our desires aren’t fixed in the way economists usually think of them. Many of our desires are in conflict. We all have urges that we long to indulge and sometimes these urges sit uneasily with us. Sometimes we long to limit our urges, whether food, sex, money, or the app on your phone that you spend time with compulsively. We have a good dog and a bad one fighting each other all the time. Feed the good dog. Feed it often enough and it starts to win the fights with the bad dog.
