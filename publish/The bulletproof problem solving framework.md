[[Problem solving is a vital skill in the 21st century]]. The Bulletproof Problem Solving approach is a systematic seven-step framework designed to facilitate effective problem-solving. It was first developed at McKinsey & Co. 

It begins by defining the problem, followed by disaggregating the problem into manageable parts. Next, priorities are established, a work plan is developed, and the necessary analytical tasks are assigned. This is followed by careful analysis to resolve the issues, while avoiding cognitive biases (which we can do more effectively when we [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]). The findings are then synthesized to highlight insights, which are communicated in a compelling manner.

> This book introduces a long‐tested and systematic approach that can be taught to anyone who wants to become a better problem solver, from corporate strategists to nonprofit workers. This powerful framework, Bulletproof Problem Solving, is an approach we learned and helped develop at McKinsey & Company, the global consulting firm. This seven‐step process hasn't been shared widely outside McKinsey until now. It can be used by individuals, teams, executives, government policy makers, and social entrepreneurs—anyone with a complex and uncertain problem of consequence. This systematic approach to problem solving could help you get a great job, make you more effective in your work, make your role as a citizen more fulfilling, and even make your personal life work better. These are big claims, but we know it works.

> The heart of the book is a seven‐step framework for creative problem solving, Bulletproof Problem Solving, starting with these critical questions: 
>  1. How do you define a problem in a precise way to meet the decision maker’s needs? 
>  2. How do you disaggregate the issues and develop hypotheses to be explored? 
>  3. How do you prioritize what to do and what not to do? 
>  4. How do you develop a workplan and assign analytical tasks? 
>  5. How do you decide on the fact gathering and analysis to resolve the issues, while avoiding cognitive biases? 
>  6. How do you go about synthesizing the findings to highlight insights? 
>  7. How do you communicate them in a compelling way?
