[[Problem solving is a vital skill in the 21st century]]. The Bulletproof Problem Solving approach is a systematic seven-step framework designed to facilitate effective problem-solving. It was first developed at McKinsey & Co. It is both consistent and complementary with design thinking, especially in cases where an understanding of the user experience is essential.

It begins by defining the problem, followed by disaggregating the problem into manageable parts. Next, priorities are established, a work plan is developed, and the necessary analytical tasks are assigned. This is followed by careful analysis to resolve the issues, while avoiding cognitive biases (which we can do more effectively when we [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]). The findings are then synthesized to highlight insights, which are communicated in a compelling manner.

From [[Bulletproof Problem Solving]]:

>Step 1: Define the problem
When a problem's context and boundaries aren't fully described, there is a lot of room for error. The first step in our process is to arrive at a problem definition that is agreed upon by those
Involved in making a decision. We test the problem definition against several criteria: that It Is specific, not general, that we can clearly measure success, that the definition is bounded both In  time frame and by the values of the decision maker, and that It involves definitive action being taken. This step may appear constraining. but It leads to the clarity of purpose essential for
good problem solving.

*NOTE: This is the most important step*
>Step 2: Disaggregate the issues
Once the problem is defined, It must be disaggregated (or broken down) into component parts or issues. We employ [[Dissecting a problem and utilizing logic trees streamlines problem-solving]] of various types to elegantly disassemble problems into parts
for analysis, driving from alternative hypotheses of the answer. There is both an art and science to "cleaving problems-revealing their fault lines-that drives better solutions. This is the stage
at which theoretical frameworks from economics and science provide useful guides to better understanding the drivers of your problem solution. We usually try several different cuts at
disaggregation to see which yields the most Insight.

>Step 3: Prioritize the issues, Prune the tree
The next step is to identify which branches of the logic tree have the biggest Impact on the problem, including which you can most affect, and focus your Initial attention on these. We employ a simple matrix of size of Impact of each lever and ability to move the lever as a way to prune our logic trees. Prioritizing analyses helps us find the critical path to the answer efficiently. making the best use of team time and resources.

>Step 4: Build a workplan and timetable
Once the component parts are defined and prioritized, you then have to link each part to a plan for fact gathering and analysis. This workplan and timetable assigns team members to analytic tasks with specific outputs and completion dates. We'll show you best practices In workplanning to move quickly and accurately to solutions. A good workplanning process also includes team norms around generating a diversity of views, use of experts, role-playing, and flattening team hierarchies to achieve better answers. Good team norms and process help us avoid common pitfalls and bases In decision making, Including confirmation blas, sunk costs fallacles, and anchoring blas.

>Step 5: Conduct Critical Analyses
Data gathering and analysis is often the longest step in the process. For speed and simplicity we start with simple heuristics-short cuts or rules of thumb-to get an order of magnitude understanding of each problem component, and to assess priorities quickly. This helps us understand where we need to do more work, and especially when and where to use more complex analytic techniques, including game theory, regression, Monte Carlo simulation, and amchine learning. To keep the team on the critical path we make frequent use of one-day answers that summarize our best understanding in the form of situation, observations, and initial conclusions - and team reviews sessions to pressure-test these hypotheses.

>Step 6: Synthesize findings from the analysis
Problem solving doesn't stop at the point of reaching conclusions from individual analyses. Findings have to be assembled into a logical structure to test validitu and then sunthesized in a way that convinces others that you have a good solution. Great team processes are also Important at this stage.

>Step 7: Prepare a powerful communication
The final step is to develop a storyline from the conclusions that link back to the problem statement and the issues that were defined. A powerful communication will use a governing thought or argument that derives from your refined situation-observation-conclusion logic from earlier stages. This will be supported with your synthesized findings and assembled into component arguments that may follow inductive or deductive logic. It will either lead with action steps, or pose a series of questions that motivate action, depending on audience receptivity.

> This book introduces a long‐tested and systematic approach that can be taught to anyone who wants to become a better problem solver, from corporate strategists to nonprofit workers. This powerful framework, Bulletproof Problem Solving, is an approach we learned and helped develop at McKinsey & Company, the global consulting firm. This seven‐step process hasn't been shared widely outside McKinsey until now. It can be used by individuals, teams, executives, government policy makers, and social entrepreneurs—anyone with a complex and uncertain problem of consequence. This systematic approach to problem solving could help you get a great job, make you more effective in your work, make your role as a citizen more fulfilling, and even make your personal life work better. These are big claims, but we know it works.
