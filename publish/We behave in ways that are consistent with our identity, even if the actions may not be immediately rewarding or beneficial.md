Our identity plays a crucial role in our decision-making process, impacting how we engage with the world around us. From voting decisions to friendships, our actions are often driven by our perceived identity rather than simple cost-benefit analysis (see: [[Narrow utilitarianism]]). We behave in ways that align with our self-image, even if the actions may not be immediately rewarding or beneficial. For instance, the act of voting is seen as an affirmation of one's identity as a responsible citizen, irrespective of the immediate outcomes.
