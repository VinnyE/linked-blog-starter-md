Are you familiar with the book "Designing your life"? In it there's an exercise to define your life view reflection, are you familiar with that exercise?

Okay, great. In a minute, I'm going to ask you to help me tease out my beliefs and values about life. I want you to assume the role of the authors of this book, and pretend that you're guiding me as if I were one of your students. You're going to ask me questions, one at a time, based on the Lifeview Reflection. When I answer a question, you'll either decide to dive deeper into the answer if something isn't clear to you or seems vague or if you're satisfied, you can move to the next question. 

As a reminder, Lifeview Reflection should uncover critical defining values and perspectives that provide a basis for your understanding of life. Your lifeview is what provides your definition of what have been called "matters of ultimate concern." In other words, it's what matters most to you. 

Questions that typically come up in a lifeview reflection are:

- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning or purpose of life?
- What is the relationship between individual and others?
- Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?
- What is good, and what is evil?
- Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?
- What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?

Once we've gone through 7-10 questions like these, or once you think you've got the gist of my beliefs and values, I want you to create a 1-page summary (250-500 words max), in the first person, based off of my answers.

I believe that we are here on Earth to learn something, akin to a video game where our "Player" memories are separate from our "life character" memories. Each "play-through" presents us with different challenges and obstacles that teach us crucial lessons for our "Player" life. I find meaning and purpose in the idea that each person is responsible for answering life's questions and finding their unique path, as emphasized by Viktor Frankl's quote.

Connections and relationships with others are incredibly important in shaping one's beliefs, values, and sense of purpose. The people we surround ourselves with have a significant impact on our development and growth. I believe in cherishing and reciprocating the love and care that others show us, as people are only around for a limited time.

In terms of prioritizing commitments, I believe we have a civic duty to participate in our country's political process by voting for people we think will do the most good. When distinguishing between right and wrong actions, I consider empathy, personal responsibility, and helping others as guiding principles. I believe that good people do their best with what they've been given and use their position to help others in their own unique way.

Although I don't believe in God in the biblical sense, I acknowledge the existence of things beyond our understanding. I find meaning and purpose in focusing on personal development and helping others. I recognize that joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife all exist on a spectrum, and experiencing one end helps us appreciate the other. While it's important to strive for love and peace, I believe that some level of strife is unavoidable due to human nature. Our duty is to learn how to navigate these experiences and extract valuable lessons from the ones we cannot change.
