The utilitarian approach, put forward by Jeremy Bentham and widely used by economists, suggests humans are motivated by maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. This perspective sees life as a sort of amusement park, where we make choices to accumulate the greatest satisfaction given our constraints. However, this view often overlooks that humans are complex creatures who seek more than just transient pleasures and pain avoidance. We also want to flourish. We want [[Eudaemonia]].
