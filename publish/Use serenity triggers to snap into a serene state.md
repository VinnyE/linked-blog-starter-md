### Developing a Serenity Trigger
We can create a psychological trigger to a serene state, which can be activated by a simple act like inhaling. [[Serenity triggers can provide the necessary calm and alertness for excelling in high-pressure moments]]. By identifying activities that relax us and establishing a daily routine around these, we gradually internalize peace and calm. This routine then becomes a tool that can help us manage stress and enhance our performance in crucial moments.
