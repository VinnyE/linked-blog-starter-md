Factors that hinder our ability to learn from reality include: 
- **Incorrect perspective**: Limited information about situation, confirmation bias, Cognitive blindspots, Overconfidence, etc. Luckily, we can [[Enhance decision-making by reducing blindspots with mental models]]
- **Ego-induced denial**: Ego can prevent us from exposing our ideas to criticism, limiting opportunities for growth and learning. If we do expose them, and our ideas are criticized, ego can step in and make us defensive leading to being shut off from new ideas. [[Self-awareness is the ego's antidote]]
- **Distance from the consequences of our decisions**: [[People with skin in the game are more likely to make better decisions because they directly face the consequences of their actions]].

As a counterpoint to this, we can leverage mental models ([[What are mental models]]) to learn to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]].

> Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions (The further we are from the results of our decisions, the easier it is to keep our current views rather than update them.)

> Our inability to learn from the world because of our ego happens for many reasons, but two are worth mentioning here. First, weâ€™re so afraid about what others will say about us that we fail to put our ideas out there and subject them to criticism. This way we can always be right. Second, if we do put our ideas out there and they are criticized, our ego steps in to protect us. We become invested in defending instead of upgrading our ideas.
