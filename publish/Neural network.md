### What are Neural Networks?
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the brain. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, which can learn to recognize patterns and relationships in the data through a process of adjusting the weights of the connections between the neurons. 

Neural networks can be used to generate continuous vector representations (see: [[Continuous vector space]]), by learning to map input data (such as text) to continuous vectors in a way that captures meaningful properties and relationships.
