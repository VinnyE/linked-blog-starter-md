### Embracing Uncertainty
Uncertainty is a part of life, as is the case in the creative process of an artist. Rather than fearing unpredictability, we can embrace it, allowing the characters of our life's story to take shape and dictate the narrative. This does not mean complete passivity; instead, it's an active engagement with the organic nature of life, open to constant discovery about the world and ourselves.
