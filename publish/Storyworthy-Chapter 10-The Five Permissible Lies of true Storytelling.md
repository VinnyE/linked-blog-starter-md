In the realm of authentic storytelling, five permissible "lies" guide storytellers to create narratives that resonate deeply with audiences. These lies are not deceitful, but rather, narrative tools: omission, where not every detail is shared to maintain interest and suspense; compression, where timelines are condensed to create a more compact, potent narrative; assumption, where specific details that are crucial but forgotten are reasonably filled in; progression, where the sequence of events may be altered for emotional impact; and conflation, where a long-lasting transformation is condensed into a shorter time frame for dramatic effect. While these tools bend the reality of the story, they respect its essential truth. However, three significant caveats protect the integrity of this process: these tools are not used for the storyteller's selfish gain, they acknowledge the fallibility of memory, and they never introduce elements that were not initially present in the story.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Ethical Boundaries of Storytelling
Storytelling, despite involving creative liberties, is based on principles of truthfulness. These ethical boundaries dictate that any alterations made to the narrative must serve the audience's interest rather than the storyteller's personal gain. The storyteller doesn’t manipulate reality or time-space for their benefit or to appear more noble or mitigate shame. The integrity of the story is upheld, ensuring that the audience is provided with an authentic narrative experience.

### The Fluidity of Memory in Storytelling
The human memory is not an infallible repository but is malleable and prone to change over time. Storytellers recognize this and understand that the retelling of a memory may alter its original version subtly. As a story is repeated, it becomes a less accurate replica of the original memory. This phenomenon emphasizes the inherent subjectivity in storytelling, which is based on personal experiences and perceptions.

### Maintaining the Authenticity of the Source Material
An authentic story respects the reality it represents and never introduces elements that were not originally present. Storytellers shape the narrative from a set of real facts and figures without adding fabricated content. Their role is to mold the raw content of a story into something entertaining and engaging. The commitment to the source material’s authenticity prevents storytellers from crossing into fiction.

### The Art of Omission
Every story strategically omits details to create suspense and maintain audience interest. The art of omission works like a coat put on the audience, making it difficult for them to remove, ensuring the story lingers in their minds long after the telling. This is used to strategically withhold information or details that might offer closure, thereby making the story more compelling.

**Note: Malcolm gladwell also spoke about this in his MasterClass speaking on the power of unfinished stories and how they linger**

### The Technique of Compression
Compression in storytelling involves manipulating time and space to simplify the narrative and enhance its dramatic effect. The technique allows storytellers to bring scenes closer together in time, creating a more cohesive, intense narrative experience. It helps in heightening the drama and suspense of a story and making it more visually stimulating.

### The Permissible Assumption
Storytellers occasionally fill in gaps in memory with reasonable assumptions, particularly when an overlooked detail is critical to the narrative. This does not mean that they fabricate details but make an educated guess about a forgotten aspect. The assumption serves to enhance the narrative without violating the principle of truthfulness.

### The Lie of Progression
Progression involves altering the sequence of events to create a more emotionally satisfying or comprehensible narrative. Although this is the least commonly used technique, it can significantly impact the audience's emotional experience, adding to the overall impact of the story.

### The Strategy of Conflation
Conflation is used to intensify the emotional impact of a narrative by compressing significant intellectual or emotional transformations into a shorter time frame. By doing so, storytellers cater to the audience's expectations of a more dramatic, entertaining story, while still respecting the truth of the transformation.

##### Important Caveat #1
- As storytellers, we only lie for the benefit of our audience. We never lie for our own personal gain. We don’t manipulate the truth, alter the fabric of reality, or shift time and space for our own benefit. We’re not in the business of making ourselves look better, appearing more noble, or mitigating our shame or failure. We lie in our stories only when our audience would want us to lie — only when the story is better for our doing so.

##### Important Caveat #2
- Memory is a slippery thing, and as storytellers, we must remember this. Research suggests that every time you tell a story, it becomes less true. Each time you remove a memory from the file cabinet of your mind and play with it for a while, you are unconsciously making changes, so when you return that folder to the file cabinet, the memory is permanently altered. We tell stories as well as we can remember them, but we must acknowledge that this is probably inaccurate in many ways. 

##### Important Caveat #3
- As storytellers, we never add something to a story that was not already there. We can manipulate the story in ways I will explain, but never, ever do we add something that did not already exist in the moment. We are not fiction tellers. We are truth tellers. We may not tell the whole truth, and we may manipulate that truth from time to time, but we start with a pile of facts and figures, and we never add to that pile. It's our job to take the raw content of a story and craft it into something entertaining, compelling, moving, and satisfying. Making something up is cheating, and great storytellers are not cheaters.

##### The Five Permissible Lies of Storytelling
**Lie #1: Omission** 
Every story contains omissions. If you were to tell every single in the story, it would never end. We all omit elements from our stories, but great storytellers do this strategically and for a variety of reasons.

Here is what I think: A story is like a coat. When we tell a story, we put a coat on our audience. Our goal is to make that coat as difficult to remove as possible. I want that coat to be impossible to take off. Days after you’ve heard my story at the dinner table or the conference room or the golf course or the theater, I want you to be thinking about my story. I want that coat to cling to your body and mind. The longer that story lingers in the hearts and minds of our audience, the better the story.

If I don’t tell my audience about my redemption, the world remains broken. I did a terrible thing, and it still weighs on my soul. It’s a much more difficult coat to remove. Days later you’ll find yourself thinking about what I did, because I will still be guilty of the crime in your mind. The world will still be broken. George is right. Audiences don’t want redemption. Redemption cleanses the palate. It ties up all loose ends. It makes the world whole again. It allows your audience to sleep well at night. I want my audience tossing and turning over my story.

When I write novels, I try to end my story about ten pages before the reader would want the book to end. In that way, I'm also putting a coat on my audience. 

Storytellers end their stories in the most advantageous place possible. They omit the endings that offer neat little bows and happily-ever-afters. The best stories are a little messy at the end. They offer small steps, marginal progress, questionable results. The best stories give rise to unanswered questions.

**Lie #2: Compression** 
Compression is used when storytellers want to push time and space together in order to make the story easier to comprehend, visualize, and tell. If the first scene of your story takes place on a Monday, for example, and the next scene happens on Friday, and you are concerned about the audience wondering about Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, you simply push time together and turn your Monday-through-Friday story into a Monday-through-Tuesday story. Placing scenes together also heightens the drama and suspense of a story. It makes the world seem more visceral and cinematic.

**Lie #3: Assumption**
Storytellers use assumption when there is a detail so important to the story that it must be stated with specificity, so the storyteller makes a reasonable assumption about what the specifics may be (like when trying to remember the model of a car in a past story). This does not mean that a storyteller should assume all details. It is only when the forgotten detail is critical to the story that an assumption should be made. 

**Lie #4: Progression** 
A lie of progression is when a storyteller changes the order of events in a story to make it more emotionally satisfying or comprehensible to the listener. In my experience, this is the least common lie told, and I have never done it myself, but I’ve recommended that other storytellers use it from time to time

it’s always better to make people laugh before they cry. It hurts more that way.

**Lie #5: Conflation**
Storytellers use conflation to push all the emotion of an event into a single time frame, because stories are more entertaining this way. Rather than describing change over a long period, we compress all the intellectual and emotional transformation into a smaller bit of time, because this is what audiences expect from stories.

Movies do this all the time. If you track the number of days that pass over the course of the average movie, the number is small. A lot of stuff is often jammed into one or two days of movie time, when in real life, no one ever has days so packed with action.
