Control in life isn't about predefining every step, but more about the ability to adapt to new information and experiences. This approach does not discard planning but instead redefines it as a flexible roadmap that can be adjusted according to the twists and turns of our journey. It's about being ready to adjust our course based on the new landscapes we encounter.
