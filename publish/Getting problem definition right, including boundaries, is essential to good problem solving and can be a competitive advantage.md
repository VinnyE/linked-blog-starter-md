title: "Getting problem definition right, including boundaries, is essential to good problem solving and can be a competitive advantage"

In order to get a good definition of a problem, you need a solid problem statement. What are you trying to solve?

> Good problem statements have a number of characteristics. They are: 
> - Outcomes focused: A clear statement of the problem to be solved, expressed in outcomes, not activities or intermediate outputs. 
> - Specific and measurable wherever possible. 
> - Clearly time‐bound. 
> - Designed to explicitly address decision‐maker values and boundaries, including the accuracy needed and the scale of aspirations. 
> - Structured to allow sufficient scope for creativity and unexpected results—too narrowly scoped problems can artificially constrain solutions. 
> - Solved at the highest level possible, meaning for the organization as a whole, not just optimized for a part or a partial solution.

> Problem statements keep on getting better when facts are brought to bear to sharpen the problem definition. We find that setting up a dialogue with questions that have to be answered is key to getting the required sharpness in problem definition.

> Charles met with many senior leaders in the newspaper trade during those years and witnessed a kind of arrogance rooted in inaccurate problem diagnosis. These managers believed that the problem statement around new competition was: “Do the new Internet entrants have better content (news and other writing) that would win over readers?” They concluded that their newspapers had editorial content that the entrants couldn't match and therefore they didn't need to worry too much. When Charles was invited to give a keynote presentation to the 1997 Newspaper Association of America annual meeting and suggested that the competitive attack would instead come from behind, from erosion of near monopoly positions in classified advertising in segments like autos, real estate, employment, and personals, the room was entirely silent.

> Over the next few years it played out as predicted. New vertical players in online classified advertising sprang up and slowly cannibalized the long‐held newspaper dominance in these categories. Consumers still wanted newspaper editorial content, but they began to find their jobs, cars, homes, and dates online, stripping away the key source of revenue for old‐line media companies. Failure or consolidation of many great newspaper names followed. This turns out to be common in cases of disruptive technology or business model innovation. **The existing players literally cannot see the threat from new entrants because their mindset, their problem boundary definition, makes them blind to it.** The takeaway point here is clear: Getting problem definition right, including boundaries, is essential to good problem solving and can be an essential competitive advantage.

*Personal note: Blockbuster vs Netflix seems similar to this*
