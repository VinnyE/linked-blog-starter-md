title: "We should be careful with inductive reasoning and the kind of logical leaps that can result from it"

Trends are a poor predictor of future events, as illustrated by Bertrand's chicken example (see: [[Understanding trends and laws in human history]]). Inductive reasoning can sometimes imply a sort of certain knowledge about the future. David Hume and [[Karl Popper]], a strong believer in [[The principle of falsifiability in science]], were no fans of induction. Popper believed induction was never needed in science, as nothing is ever proven for certain, and in that sense is "fallibilistic." Though, this doesn't mean inductive reasoning has no utility. Often scientists use past observations to make predictions about future events or to develop theories, even though these predictions or theories can't be justified with absolute certainty. Despite this, the process of falsification Popper advocated for helps to account for potential errors in inductive reasoning.
