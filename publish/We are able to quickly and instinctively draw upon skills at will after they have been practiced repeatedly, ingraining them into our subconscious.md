### The Power of Subconscious Learning
In the learning process, technical details and principles initially dominate our understanding. With time and practice, these details transition from being explicit numerical values to intuitive concepts. By continually practicing a skill, the action eventually becomes second nature, and the artist is able to execute the movement without conscious thought. This indicates that the skill has been ingrained deeply into their subconscious mind, allowing them to draw upon it instinctively and rapidly in real-world applications. This form of subconscious learning serves as a platform for more advanced learning and action.
