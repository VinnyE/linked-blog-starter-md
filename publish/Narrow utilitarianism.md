"Narrow utilitarianism" refers to a perspective or approach that focuses primarily on immediate self-interest and personal gain, often at the expense of broader ethical considerations or principles. Utilitarianism, in its broadest sense, is a philosophical concept that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes overall "happiness" or "utility."

However, when this concept is applied narrowly, it can lead to decisions that prioritize short-term benefits or pleasures without considering long-term consequences, ethical implications, or impacts on others. This narrow focus can sometimes lead to actions that are self-serving and may not align with one's broader values or principles related to personal growth and flourishing.
