A one-day answer is a coherent summary of ones best understanding of the problem and best guess at a solution path at any point in the project. Creating hypotheses in this way to surface arguments that can be falsified is the core of [[Bulletproof Problem Solving]].

> We often use the expression, “What's the one‐day answer?” This means we ask our team to have a coherent summary of our best understanding of the problem and a solution path at any point in the project, not just at the end. This process of creating active hypotheses is at the heart of Bulletproof Problem Solving.
