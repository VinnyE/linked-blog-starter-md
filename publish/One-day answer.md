A one-day answer is a coherent summary of ones best understanding of the problem and best guess at a solution path at any point in the project. Creating hypotheses in this way to surface arguments that can be falsified is the core of [[Bulletproof Problem Solving]].

One-day answers are usually organized in three parts:
- A short description of the situation that needs to be solved (aka the set up of the problem)
- A set of observations or complications around the situation that creates the tension or dynamic that captures the problem. (aka what changed/went wrong that created the problem)
- The best idea of the implication or resolution of the problem occurring. This will be progressively refined into an idea that answers the question "what should we do"?

> We often use the expression, “What's the one‐day answer?” This means we ask our team to have a coherent summary of our best understanding of the problem and a solution path at any point in the project, not just at the end. This process of creating active hypotheses is at the heart of Bulletproof Problem Solving. 

> There are many ways to structure one‐day answers, but the classic way employed in McKinsey and elsewhere is to organize them in three parts: A short description of the situation that prevails at the outset of problem solving. This is the state of affairs that sets up the problem. A set of observations or complications around the situation that creates the tension or dynamic that captures the problem. This is typically what changed, or what went wrong that created the problem. The best idea of the implication or resolution of the problem that you have right now. At the beginning this will be rough and speculative. Later it will be a more and more refined idea that answers the question, “What should we do?”
