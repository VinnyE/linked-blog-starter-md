title: "Maps and models simplify complexity with inherent limitations"

In our daily lives, we rely on a variety of maps, models, and abstractions to simplify complex concepts and navigate reality (see: [[The map is not the territory - abstractions must be distinguished from reality]]). From financial statements to policy documents, these tools serve as valuable guides that help us simplify intricate information and make decisions more efficiently. However, it is crucial to remember that these representations are not perfect reflections of reality; they are reductions and subject to the biases and limitations of their creators. The best maps are still imperfect and may represent a snapshot of a point in time, which might not accurately reflect the current situation. This is why we need to [[Continuously update maps and models for accuracy]].

> The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. Thatâ€™s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. This is important to keep in mind as we think through problems and make better decisions.

> We use maps every day. They help us navigate from one city to another. They help us reduce complexity to simplicity. Think of the financial statements for a company, which are meant to distill the complexity of thousands of transactions into something simpler. Or a policy document on office procedure, a manual on parenting a two-year-old, or your performance review. All are models or maps that simplify some complex territory in order to guide you through it.
