Conditional probability is a concept within [[Probabalistic thinking]] that focuses on the conditions surrounding historical events when making predictions. It differentiates between independent and dependent events, where the outcomes of dependent events are conditional on preceding events. Understanding conditional probability helps [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]] by considering the context of past events and adjusting predictions based on those conditions.

> Conditional probability is similar to Bayesian thinking in practice, but comes at it from a different angle. When you use historical events to predict the future, you have to be mindful of the conditions that surrounded that event. Events can be independent, like tossing a coin, or dependent. In the latter case, it means the outcomes of an event are conditional on what preceded them.
