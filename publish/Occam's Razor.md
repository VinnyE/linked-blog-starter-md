The principle of Occam's Razor advocates for simplicity as a guiding factor in understanding and explaining phenomena. This mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) posits that the simplest explanation — that is, the one with the fewest assumptions or "moving parts" — is often the most accurate. By applying Occam's Razor, we can sift through numerous complex scenarios and identify the most likely truth with greater confidence and efficiency.

This principle not only streamlines decision-making processes but also enhances the validity of our explanations. Simpler explanations are more accessible and easier to understand (see: [[Simple ideas are valuable because they can help us prevent complex problems]]), making them more likely to be scrutinized and, if necessary, falsified. This concept of falsifiability aligns with the philosophy of science, where an explanation's strength is measured by its susceptibility to being proven wrong. See [[The principle of falsifiability in science]].

However, it's important to note that simplicity isn't always attainable. Irreducible complexity exists in our reality, and this is where Occam's Razor hits its limit. There are scenarios where a phenomenon cannot be distilled any further, retaining a complexity that we must learn to navigate. In these instances, we're tasked with understanding and dealing with the situation in its entirety, acknowledging that not all aspects of reality can be simplified without loss of essential detail. Despite its value, Occam's Razor shouldn't be used to enforce artificial simplicity on inherently complex situations. Lest we fool ourselves into using a flawed model and we know [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]].

> Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. This is the essence of Occam’s Razor, a classic principle of logic and problem-solving. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove complex scenarios, you can make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation that has the fewest moving parts. 

> They are easier to falsify, easier to understand, and generally more likely to be correct.

> Simple as we wish things were, irreducible complexity, like simplicity, is a part of our reality. Therefore, we can’t use this Razor to create artificial simplicity. If something cannot be broken down any further, we must deal with it as it is.
