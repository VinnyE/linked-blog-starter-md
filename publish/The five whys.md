The five whys is another technique we can use to uncover [[First principles thinking and its evolving nature]]. Similar to what children often do, the five whys involves repeatedly asking "why?" until you land on a "what" or "how". If this answer is abides is falsifiable (see: [[The principle of falsifiability in science]]), then you can likely consider said answer a first principle. Otherwise, the answer may just be the currently accepted dogma or myth. 

The five whys are not really a tool for introspection, but more a system for reliably figuring out the roots of a statement or concept. (note to self: seems like it could be useful to [[Navigate unfamiliar domains effectively by leveraging expertise and mental models]]).

> The goal of the Five Whys is to land on a “what” or “how”. It is not about introspection, such as “Why do I feel like this?” Rather, it is about systematically delving further into a statement or concept so that you can separate reliable knowledge from assumption. If your “whys” result in a statement of falsifiable fact, you have hit a first principle. If they end up with a “because I said so” or ”it just is”, you know you have landed on an assumption that may be based on popular opinion, cultural myth, or dogma. These are not first principles.
