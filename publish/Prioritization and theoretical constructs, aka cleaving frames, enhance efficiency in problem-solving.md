title: "Prioritization and theoretical constructs, aka cleaving frames, enhance efficiency in problem-solving"

Prioritizing which parts of the problem to address first is critical, especially before substantial time and effort are invested in planning and analysis. A 2x2 matrix, considering the impact of your efforts and your ability to influence a problem lever or branch, can be an effective tool for this prioritization process.

Successful problem solvers often utilize theoretical constructs or frameworks ([[What are mental models]]), like return on capital trees for business problems, as tools to visualize potential solutions. They apply and even combine these frames depending on the problem at hand. 

**Word of caution**: One must be cautious not to get too attached to their initial problem perspective or rely too heavily on external views (especially when dealing with problems outside of your [[Circle of competence]]), as these could lead to misapplication of frames. Regular constructive challenging, brainstorming, and asking "what you'd have to believe" questions can stimulate creative solutions and avoid cognitive bias. Remember, we must [[Continuously update maps and models for accuracy]] and [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]].

> Before we start to invest significant time and effort into work planning and analysis, we have to prune our trees. We have found a 2x2 matrix to be useful forcing device for prioritization of which levers to work on. The left-hand axis is whether or not your efforts could have an impact on the problem lever or branch. The bottom axis is how important that lever is in affecting the overall problem you are trying to solve. Ex: First row: high impact low ability to influence, high impact high ability to influence. Second row: low impact low ability to influence, low impact high ability to influence. 

> Just as return on capital trees are often an incredibly insightful type of problem disaggregation for business problems, other theoretical constructs or frameworks can be powerful cleaving tools for other kinds of problems. Good problem solvers have toolkits like this that act as lenses to visualize potential solutions. They try on one or more theoretical frames to see which one is likely to be the best fit for the problem at hand. Often they combine more than one frame to make progress on particular problems. Ex: Supply/Demand, Principal/Agent, Work/Play

> The most powerful way to reach a useful disaggregation of a problem is to start with a particular cleaving frame and then do some back of the envelope calculations to confirm that it would provide insight.

> While it is a good idea to consult the literature and look for best practices around your problem, it is not uncommon for individuals to get attached to their initial cut through the problem, and as mentioned earlier, reliance on external views creates a risk of applying incorrect frames. This is even—or especially—true of experts. Use of constructive challenging and “what you'd have to believe” questions can help get the process out of ruts, and foster more creativity in solution paths. Team brainstorming sessions can really help avoid attachment in problem prioritization.
