According to the authors of [[Bulletproof Problem Solving]], problem solving is decision making when there is complexity and uncertainty that rules out obvious answers ([[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]), and where there are are consequences that make the work to get good answers worth it. 

In a rapidly changing world, with accelerating advancements in technology and shifts in business models, problem-solving skills have never been more crucial. Our previous training methods for careers are quickly becoming outdated. Being able to creatively navigate complex and uncertain situations is a critical ability, and it's this skill that the World Economic Forum identified as the most valuable in the 21st century. 

Problem-solving is not confined to a specific job role or industry; organizations across all sectors are realizing its importance. Whether you work in the corporate world or on the inspection line of a plant, the ability to see and organize responses to problems has become a core requisite. The world today doesn't merely reward knowledge—it rewards the ability to apply knowledge in resolving complex issues. [[The true value of comprehension emerges when it leads to meaningful changes in our actions and behavior]]

Also note: Problem solving is an iterative process, not a linear one. The cycle can be completed over any timeframe with the current information. Once you reach an initial endpoint, you can repeat the process for more insights or to gain a deeper understanding. 

A counter to this: [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]

> Whether you work in industry, the nonprofit sector, or government, there is no way to anticipate and plan for the new structures and operating rules that are unfolding. Nor is simply accelerating and adapting traditional, domain‐oriented, training approaches sufficient. The only way to successfully navigate this level of change is to be a fluid and creative problem solver. That's why the World Economic Forum labeled complex problem solving its number one skill for the twenty‐first century. 

> Great problem solving has never been more important for business and society. The problems facing humankind are larger, more complex, and moving faster than ever before. Previous approaches to training for careers are now outmoded as change in technologies and business models accelerates. Learning how to define a problem, creatively break it into manageable parts, and systematically work toward a solution has become the core skill for the twenty‐first century workforce, the only way to keep up. But how problem solving is taught in our schools, universities, businesses, and organizations is coming up short. We need a new approach. 

>  We encourage you to think of problem-solving as an iterative process rather than a linear one. This cycle can be completed over any timeframe with the information at hand. Once you reach a preliminary end point, you can repeat the process to draw out more insight for deeper understanding.
