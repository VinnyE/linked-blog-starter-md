title: "Avoiding common pitfalls is key to effective problem solving"

Effective problem-solving practices can be hampered by several common mistakes. These include weak problem statements lacking in specificity, assertions of solutions based on experience or analogy without proper testing (Maybe outside of your [[Circle of competence]]), failure to break down the problem into component parts ([[Techniques for uncovering first principles]]), neglecting team structure and norms, not having a complete analytical tool set, and failing to link conclusions to a course of action ([[The true value of comprehension emerges when it leads to meaningful changes in our actions and behavior]]). It is important to recognize and avoid these pitfalls for successful problem-solving.

> 1. Weak problem statements. Too many problem statements lack specificity, clarity around decision‐maker criteria and constraints, an indication of action that will occur if the problem is solved, or a time frame or required level of accuracy for solving the problem. Rushing into analysis with a vague problem statement is a clear formula for long hours and frustrated clients.
> 2. Asserting the answer. The assertion is often based on experience or analogy (“I've seen this before”), without testing to see if that solution is really a good fit for the problem at hand. Answers like this are corrupted by availability bias (drawing only on facts at hand), anchoring bias (selecting a numerical range you have seen already), or confirmation bias (seeing only data that aligns with your prejudices).
> 3. Failure to disaggregate the problem. We see few problems that can ever be solved without disaggregation into component parts. (Need to find the right way to cleave a problem)
> 4. Neglecting team structure and norms. Our experiences in team problem solving in McKinsey and other organizations highlight the importance of a diversity of experience and divergent views in the group, having people who are open‐minded, a group dynamic that can be either competitive or collaborative, and training and team processes to reduce the impact of biases.
> 5. Incomplete analytic tool set. Some issues can be resolved with back of the envelope calculations. Others demand time and sophisticated techniques. For example, sometimes no amount of regression analysis is a substitute for a well‐designed, real‐world experiment that allows variables to be controlled and a valid counterfactual examined. Other times analysis fails because teams don't have the right tools.
> 6. Failing to link conclusions with a storyline for action. Analytically oriented teams often say, “We're done” when the analysis is complete, but without thinking about how to synthesize and communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences.
> 7. Treating the problem solving process as one‐off rather than an iterative one. Rarely is a problem solved once and for all. Problems we will discuss often have a messiness about them that takes you back and forth between hypotheses, analysis, and conclusions, each time deepening your understanding.
