Effective teaching is an art that requires deep attunement to each student's individual learning style and unique voice. The objective is not to merely disseminate information but to cultivate a learner's potential, while simultaneously kindling their interest and curiosity. Teachers must find a delicate equilibrium between fostering enthusiasm and enforcing discipline, and between encouraging independent thought and guiding the assimilation of facts and techniques. Instead of doling out either unfounded praise or undue criticism, educators should elicit thoughtful discussions about learners’ ideas and methods and coach them in a manner that respects their individuality. By adopting a role as facilitators of growth rather than as absolute authorities, teachers can instill a lifelong passion for knowledge acquisition and application in their students.

This tailored approach to teaching is exemplified in the story of Bruce, a chess mentor. Bruce's pedagogical technique involved engaging his student in thought-provoking dialogue to promote a deeper understanding of the decision-making process. He didn't shy away from asking his student to justify their moves and to contemplate alternative strategies. This balanced approach ensured that the student felt neither patronized with undue praise nor disheartened with harsh criticism. Instead of simply offering answers, Bruce's method involved shared moments of contemplation, guiding the student to develop their cognitive abilities autonomously. This approach not only nurtured the student's love for chess but also ensured that the passion for the game wasn't overshadowed by mere technical details.

The journey towards becoming a high performer involves maintaining a harmonious relationship with your pursuit that aligns with your inherent nature. At times, it will be necessary to venture out of your comfort zone and assimilate new ideas and information. However, it is crucial to ensure that these new elements are integrated in a way that doesn't conflict with your true self. Such mindful integration helps maintain your passion, stimulates personal growth, and leads to sustainable high performance.

> Bruce slowed me down by asking questions. Whenever I made an important decision, good or bad, he would ask me to explain my thought process. Were there other ways to accomplish the same aim? Had I looked for my opponent’s threats? Did I consider a different order of operations? Bruce didn’t patronize me—some teachers rebel so far away from being authoritarian that they praise all their little player’s decisions, good or bad. Their intention is to build confidence, but instead they discourage objectivity, encourage self-indulgence, and perhaps most destructively, they create a dishonest relationship between instructor and pupil that any bright child can sense.

> When I made a bad move, Bruce asked me what my idea was and then helped me discover how I could have approached the decision-making process differently. Much of the time in our lessons was spent in silence, with us both thinking. Bruce did not want to feed me information, but to help my mind carve itself into maturity… The most important factor in these first months of study was that Bruce nurtured my love for chess, and he never let technical material smother my innate feeling for the game.

> One of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition. There will inevitably be times when we need to try new ideas, release our current knowledge to take in new information – but it is critical to integrate this new information in a manner that does not violate who we are.

> The first step to artful teaching is tuning in to the essence of the student. It is critical that we appreciate each individual’s unique learning style and natural voice, and take these into account when instructing them. By allowing students to express themselves through their learning process and what they learn, we not only expand their capabilities but also their interest in forging ahead. Teachers have a very fine line to walk in preserving in their students a balance between passion and discipline, analysis and internalization of fact and technique. This balancing act demands that they neither offer false compliments nor dismiss seemingly wayward ideas—but rather prompt probing discussions of students’ ideas and methods and coach them in a manner that is in keeping with who they are. A sensitive, tailored teaching strategy accompanied by a clearly expressed expectation of achievement can make the difference between helping students’ minds carve themselves into maturity and stripping them of this ability as well as their joy. Teachers who position themselves more as guides to development than as omniscient authorities end up promoting in pupils a lifelong hunger for absorbing, processing, and applying knowledge effectively. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/art-of-introspection/listen-first/
