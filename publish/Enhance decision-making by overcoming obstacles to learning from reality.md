title: "Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality"

When we reduce our blindspots with solid mental models, we come closer to reality. [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] is beneficial for this as it helps improve our thinking. We can start to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]] by using simple processes to explore problems from various dimensions and perspectives. This approach leads to better decision-making and finding more effective solutions. However, we need to overcome obstacles to achieve this.

Factors that hinder our ability to learn from reality include: 
- **Incorrect perspective**: Limited information about situation, confirmation bias, Cognitive blindspots, Overconfidence, etc.
- **Ego-induced denial**: Ego can hinder our openness to criticism, limiting growth and learning. When criticized, ego can make us defensive, shutting us off from new ideas. [[Self-awareness is the ego's antidote]]
- **Distance from the consequences of our decisions**: [[People with skin in the game are more likely to make better decisions because they directly face the consequences of their actions]].


Failing to overcome these obstacles can lead to [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]]. To avoid this, we should leverage mental models ([[What are mental models]]) to reveal reality and make better decisions.

> In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins. Removing blind spots means we see, interact with, and move closer to understanding reality. We think better. And thinking better is about finding simple processes that help us work through problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives, allowing us to better choose solutions that fit what matters to us. The skill for finding the right solutions for the right problems is one form of wisdom. 

> Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions (The further we are from the results of our decisions, the easier it is to keep our current views rather than update them.)

> Our inability to learn from the world because of our ego happens for many reasons, but two are worth mentioning here. First, we’re so afraid about what others will say about us that we fail to put our ideas out there and subject them to criticism. This way we can always be right. Second, if we do put our ideas out there and they are criticized, our ego steps in to protect us. We become invested in defending instead of upgrading our ideas.

> Now you can see how we make suboptimal decisions and repeat mistakes. We are afraid to learn and admit when we don’t know enough. This is the mindset that leads to poor decisions. They are a source of stress and anxiety, and consume massive amounts of time. Not when we’re making them—no, when we’re making them they seem natural because they align with our view of how we want things to work. We get tripped up when the world doesn’t work the way we want it to or when we fail to see what is. Rather than update our views, we double down our effort, accelerating our frustrations and anxiety. It’s only weeks or months later, when we’re spending massive amounts of time fixing our mistakes, that they start to increase their burden on us. Then we wonder why we have no time for family and friends and why we’re so consumed by things outside of our control. 

> But we are not passive participants in our decisions. The world does not act on us as much as it reveals itself to us and we respond.
