In storytelling, surprise is the key to eliciting emotional reactions from your audience. Unlike in real life, where emotions can be triggered by various factors, in a story, surprise is what fuels emotional responses. To achieve this, you must strategically use your words to build and enhance surprises. One way to do this is by contrasting the world before and after the surprise event. Another way is by hiding important information that only comes to light at the perfect moment. However, there are pitfalls to avoid, such as prematurely revealing the surprise or failing to properly hide crucial information. These mistakes dampen the surprise and make the story predictable. Hence, mastering the art of surprise in storytelling involves avoiding thesis statements, using stakes to increase surprise, and skillfully hiding vital details to preserve the element of surprise.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Role of Surprise in Storytelling
Surprise is an essential element in storytelling, serving as the main catalyst for emotional reactions in the audience. Unlike real life where various factors can trigger emotions, in the realm of storytelling, the artful use of surprise is what stirs emotional responses.

### The Art of Crafting Surprise
Crafting surprise in storytelling involves strategic use of words and careful orchestration of events. It's about painting contrasting pictures of the world before and after the surprise, as well as hiding important information that will be revealed at the right moment for maximum impact.

### Pitfalls in Crafting Surprise
To effectively use surprise in storytelling, one must avoid common mistakes that can ruin the surprise. These include prematurely revealing the surprise through thesis statements, failing to heighten the stakes, and not properly hiding crucial information that should only be revealed at the right moment.

### Strategies for Preserving and Enhancing Surprise
Preserving and enhancing surprise involves a set of strategies: avoiding thesis statements, heightening the contrast between the surprise and the moment preceding it, leveraging stakes to increase surprise, and cleverly hiding important information (planting bombs) within the story. These strategies ensure that the surprise is well-preserved and delivers the maximum emotional impact.

### References

> When it comes to storytelling, I believe that surprise is the only way to elicit an emotional reaction from your audience. Whether it’s laughter, tears, anger, sadness, outrage, or any other emotional response, the key is surprise. This is unlike real life, where many things can give rise to an emotional reaction, and surprise is not always required.
> 
> In real life, there are many reasons to experience an emotional response. But in storytelling, we don’t have the ability to overwhelm an audience with grief. We can’t create prolonged periods of nervousness or excitement. We can’t cause physical pain. We can’t recreate these depths of experience. All we have is words. We must use our words strategically to create and enhance surprise for our audience.
> 
> Audiences react with shock and sympathy when my car collides head-on with the Mercedes, mostly because, as terrible as they suspect a head-on collision can be, they don't expect to discover that my entire bottom row of teeth would be knocked to the back of my mouth or that my head would crash through the windshield. I enhance this surprise through contrast. I paint a very different picture of the world right before the collision. 
> 
> Audiences become emotional and often cry upon learning that my friends have filled the waiting room outside the emergency room, because this is also a surprise. They never see it coming. Part of the reason is that I hide important information in the story, but it's also because I accentuate the surprise by stressing the idea that I am alone. I paint the picture of a boy who is badly hurt and completely alone in a place where no one even knows his name. I’ve primed the audience for an emotional response by playing upon their sympathy, empathy, and outrage. My parents decide to check on the car before checking on me. The nurses don’t know my name. It’s two days before Christmas. I feel utterly alone. When I say the words, “But I’m not alone, because . . .” audience members will sometimes start crying even before they hear the reason. I’ve primed the pump for surprise.

##### How to Ruin Surprise
> Storytellers often mitigate or even ruin surprise by making some simple mistakes or failing to accentuate or enhance the potential surprise of the moment. Common mistakes that storytellers make that ruin surprise include:

> **Presenting a thesis statement prior to the surprise.** 
> This often takes the form of an opening sentence that gives away all that is surprising about the story. “This is a story about a time in my life when my friends became my family.” “This is a story about a car accident so serious that it took my life, if only for a moment.” 
> 
> But storytelling is the reverse of the five-paragraph essay. Instead of opening with a thesis statement and then supporting it with evidence, storytellers provide the evidence first and then sometimes offer the thesis statement later only when necessary. This is how we allow for surprise.
> 
> The same holds true for smaller moments of surprise within stories. For example, in describing the way my grandmother pulled my teeth, I have two choices: 
> 
> *Option #1 My grandmother tied a length of string around my loose tooth. She leaned in close so our two faces were just inches apart. She told me to look her straight in the eyes. “Don’t blink,” she warned. Then she wrapped the other end of the string around her fist, raised it between our noses, smiled, and pulled down. Hard. My grandmother was a sadist.* 
> 
> *Option #2 My grandmother was a sadist. She tied a length of string around my loose tooth. She leaned in close so our two faces were just inches apart. She told me to look her straight in the eyes. “Don’t blink,” she warned. Then she wrapped the other end of the string around her fist, raised it between our noses, smiled, and pulled down. Hard.* 
> 
> See the difference? In option #1, the thesis statement comes at the end of the paragraph, allowing for my grandmother’s method of pulling my teeth to be as surprising as possible. That thesis statement “My grandmother was a sadist” also probably adds a laugh at the end to punctuate the moment.
> 
> Thesis statements ruin the surprise every time. In storytelling, our job is to describe action, dialogue, and thought. It is never our job to summarize these things.
> 
> **Failing to take advantage of the power of stakes to enhance and accentuate surprise.** 
> Remember in “Charity Thief” when I put a Backpack on my audience before I enter that gas station? I describe my plan for begging for gas in great detail. It sounds like a plausible idea. Probable, even. My audience is rooting for me. They expect me to get the gas I need. I know this because when I tell this story in workshops, I see the same reaction every time I say, “But the kid won’t give me the gas.” Shoulders slump. Faces contort in anger. People groan. They shake their heads in disgust. They experience an emotional reaction very similar to the one I experienced that day. Why? They are surprised. They wanted my plan to work. They expected it to work. It sounds like something that should have worked. If I don’t explain my plan before I enter the gas station, no one is surprised if the kid says no. He should say no. Who gives away free gas? It’s only when I load up my audience with a complete description of my plan, as well as all my hopes and dreams, that they experience the surprise of the refusal.

> **Failing to hide critical information in a story.**
> As storytellers, we must hide pertinent information from our audiences to allow the surprise to pay off later. I often refer to this as planting a bomb in a story that will explode when the time is right. 
> 
> *Hiding the Bomb in the Clutter* 
> We hide these important moments by making them seem unimportant. We do this by hiding critical information among other details. We make the important information seem no more important than the rest of the information by pushing it all together. 
> 
> In the case of “This Is Going to Suck,” I turn my all-important request for the nurse to call McDonald’s into just another detail by placing it amid a series of doctors’ and nurses’ interactions with me. Rather than highlighting the encounter, I add it to a long list: 
> Nurses picking glass from my forehead
> Dental surgeons wiring teeth
> Doctors prepping my knees for surgery
> A nurse asking for contact information
> 
> *Camouflage*
> I also camouflage the bomb within a laugh. Laughter is the best camouflage, because it is also an emotional response, and audience members assume that the laugh is the result of the storyteller’s wanting to be funny. This is never the case. Comedians want to be funny. Great storytellers want to be remembered. For this reason, they deploy laughter strategically. I’ll talk more about this in the next chapter, but when it comes to preserving surprise, laughter is an excellent way to hide something important that needs to surprise the audience later on. 
> 
> A laugh can draw attention away from the importance and relevance of a moment. It makes the moment feel like a storyteller's attempt at a joke instead of the conveying of a critical bit of information. This is an exceptionally important concept in storytelling. If you can’t hide critical details and preserve the surprise, the audience sees it coming a mile away. In that case, you may as well not even tell your story.

> To review, the strategies for preserving and enhancing surprise in a story: 
> 1.​ Avoid thesis statements in storytelling. 
> 2.​ Heighten the contrast between the surprise and the moment just before the surprise. 
> 3.​ Use stakes to increase surprise. 
> 4.​ Avoid giving away the surprise in your story by hiding important information that will pay off later (planting bombs). This is done by: 
> 	•​Obscuring them in a list of other details or examples.
> 	•​Placing them as far away from the surprise as possible.
> 	•​When possible, building a laugh around them to further camouflage their importance.
