In the pursuit of mastering a technique, such as a straight punch, the journey begins with slow, deliberate, and expansive practice. Over time, understanding deepens and movements become more internalized and potent, leading to a reduction in physical expansiveness but an increase in power. This process, akin to an experienced singer knowing how a note feels rather than relying on auditory feedback, requires one to internalize the sensations associated with performing the action correctly. By persistently practicing, the artist gradually refines and condenses the action, making it quicker, more efficient, and almost invisible to the untrained eye. This principle, known as 'Making Smaller Circles,' emphasizes the gradual transformation of grand gestures into more subtle, yet equally powerful movements. Thus, the essence of mastery lies in being able to perform a task without conscious thought, having internalized the associated mechanics through repetitive practice.

## Concept Breakdown

[[Mastery of a skill begins with understanding and practicing the basic foundational activities of that skill repeatedly]]

[[Making smaller circles is the name for the process of internalization which allows for the execution of a skill to become quicker and more efficient]]

[[We are able to quickly and instinctively draw upon skills at will after they have been practiced repeatedly, ingraining them into our subconscious]]

[[True mastery often looks deceptively simple to the untrained eye]]

> The next phase of my martial growth would involve turning the large into the small. My understanding of this process… is to touch the essence (for example, highly refined and deeply internalized body mechanics or feeling) of a technique while keeping true to its essence. Over time expansiveness decreases while potency increases

> Let’s say that I am cultivating a certain martial technique—for a simple example, a classic straight punch. I stand with my left leg forward, my hands up by my head to protect my face. The jab is a short punch coming from the left, forward hand. The straight is the power punch coming from the ground, generating through my left foot, and moving through my left leg, torso, diagonally across and up to the right side of my back, through the shoulder, tricep, and finally delivered by the second and third knuckles of my right hand. First, I practice the motion over and over in slow motion. We have to be able to do something slowly before we can have any hope of doing it correctly with speed. I release my left hip, wind up, and spring the right hand into motion as my left foot and hip joint spin my waist and upper body into action. 
> 
> Initially I’ll have tension in my shoulder or back, but then I’ll sooth it away, slowly repeating the movement until the correct body mechanics are in my skin. Over time, I’m not thinking about the path from foot to fist, I’m just feeling the ground connecting to my fingertips, as if my body is a conduit for the electrical impulse of a punch. Then I start speeding things up, winding up and delivering, over and over. Eventually I start using a heavy bag, practicing these body mechanics with increasing power, building resistance in my body so I can deliver more and more force without hurting myself. My coiling gets stronger and sometimes I hit the bag with a surprising pop. A dangerous moment. When hitting something instead of moving through empty space, I might start to get excited and throw my shoulder into the punch. This is a classic error. It breaks my structure and destroys the connection from foot to fingertip—many boxers make this mistake and come away with shoulder injuries. I want to punch without punching. No intention. My teacher William Chen sometimes teaches punching by telling students to pour a cup of tea. It’s a beautiful thing. Pouring tea creates the perfect punch, because people’s minds don’t get in the way. 
> 
> Okay, so now weeks and months (maybe years) pass with the cultivation of the right straight punch. I know how to wind up properly. When I hit the bag, nothing hurts, there are no breaks in my structure. It feels as if the ground is smashing the bag through my fist, and my body mechanics are smooth and relaxed. I’ve also built up quite a bit of power from all the work with winding up, coiling, and releasing the body into motion. When throwing my right, I don’t think about anything technical anymore, my body just knows the right feeling and does it. No mind. It’s in the blood. I’ve learned how to throw a straight right. But not really.

> The thing is, unless they are flustered or caught in an awkward moment, a good fighter is rarely going to get caught with a big ol’ long wound-up straight punch. It’s just too obvious. This is where Making Smaller Circles comes into play. By now the body mechanics of the punch have been condensed in my mind to a feeling. I don’t need to hear or see any effect—my body knows when it is operating correctly by an internal sense of harmony. A parallel would be a trained singer who, through years of practice, knows what the notes feel like vibrating inside. Then she is giving a concert in a big venue and the sound system is a nightmare. From onstage, she can’t hear herself at all—a surprisingly common occurrence. The great performer can deliver a virtuoso performance without hearing a thing, because she knows how the notes should feel coming out, even if her primary monitor—her ears—are temporarily unavailable.

> So I know what a properly delivered straight right feels like. Now I begin to slowly, incrementally, condense my movements while maintaining that feeling. Instead of a big wind-up in the hips, I coil a little less, and then I release the punch. While initially I may have thrown my straight from next to my ear, now I gradually inch my hand out, starting the punch from closer and closer to the target—and I don’t lose power! The key is to take small steps, so the body can barely feel the condensing practice. Each little refinement is monitored by the feeling of the punch, which I gained from months or years of training with the large, traditional motion. Slowly but surely, my body mechanics get more and more potent. My waist needs little movement to generate speed. My hand can barely move and still deliver a powerful blow. Eventually I can deliver a straight punch that looks nothing like a straight punch. If you’ve ever watched some of the most explosive hitters in the boxing world, for instance Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali, you’ve seen fights where knockouts look completely unrealistic. Sometimes you have to watch in slow motion, over and over, to see any punch at all. They have condensed large circles into very small ones, and made their skills virtually invisible to the untrained eye.

> We have to be able to do something slowly before we can do it quickly. By delving with laser-like focus into a basic set of concepts or practices over a period of time, we can gradually internalize the knowledge. The process of reviewing and creatively exploring these basics over and over again leads to a very refined, nuanced understanding of them. We eventually integrate the principles into our subconscious mind where we can draw on them instinctively and rapidly without conscious thoughts getting in the way. This deeply ingrained knowledge base can serve as a meaningful springboard for more advanced learning and action. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/advanced-learning/make-smaller-circles/
