### What is Cosine similarity?
Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine the similarity between two vectors in a continuous vector space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, which effectively measures how closely the vectors are oriented to each other, regardless of their magnitudes. The cosine similarity value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 represents identical vectors, 0 means the vectors are orthogonal (unrelated), and -1 indicates completely opposite vectors.
