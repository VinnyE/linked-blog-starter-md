### What is a Continuous Vector Space?
A continuous vector space, in the context of embeddings and machine learning, is a mathematical space where data points are represented as vectors with continuous (real) values as their components. In such a space, you can perform vector arithmetic (see: [[Cosine similarity]]) and use various distance metrics to quantify the relationships between vectors, making it easier to perform mathematical operations and apply machine learning algorithms.

### How are Continuous Vector Spaces used?
In natural language processing, for example, words or phrases are transformed into embeddings represented as continuous vectors, where semantically similar words have similar vector representations in the continuous vector space. **This property allows you to perform arithmetic operations on word vectors to discover relationships or analogies between words (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" â‰ˆ "queen").**
