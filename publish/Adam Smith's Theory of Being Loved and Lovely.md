Adam Smith, the economist and moral philosopher, postulated that humans naturally desire to be "loved" and "lovely." The term "loved" encompasses more than just emotional affection; it signifies being valued, appreciated, admired, and respected. "Lovely," on the other hand, signifies being worthy of such appreciation and respect. This inherent desire to be loved and lovely resonates closely with the concept of [[Flourishing]] and represents our drive to matter in the world.
