title: "Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes"

When we do not have accurate models for a situation, we make poor decisions and repeat mistakes. This can happen when either our model of reality is wrong (doesn't survive real world experience), or when our model is right but we apply it to the wrong situation. A good example of this is how Doctors believed bloodletting cured many different illnesses, which was ultimately a misunderstanding of the situation, leading to many patient deaths. 

Poor decisions and repeat mistakes can also lead unnecessary stress, anxiety and lost time. Even worse is that the consequences of our decisions may not show right away. It's only after some time has passed and we're having to pay for our mistakes down the road do we recognize the value of good decision making in the moment. As [[Charlie Munger]] has noted, [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]. This is why we should try our best to [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]

Suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes also stem from not being rooted in the present. Repeated mistakes can often compound when we fail to update our models and refuse to see reality for what it is right now. See [[Beyond The First Mistake]].

> Now you can see how we make suboptimal decisions and repeat mistakes. We are afraid to learn and admit when we don’t know enough. This is the mindset that leads to poor decisions. They are a source of stress and anxiety, and consume massive amounts of time. Not when we’re making them—no, when we’re making them they seem natural because they align with our view of how we want things to work. We get tripped up when the world doesn’t work the way we want it to or when we fail to see what is. Rather than update our views, we double down our effort, accelerating our frustrations and anxiety. It’s only weeks or months later, when we’re spending massive amounts of time fixing our mistakes, that they start to increase their burden on us. Then we wonder why we have no time for family and friends and why we’re so consumed by things outside of our control. 

> For a long time people believed that bloodletting cured many different illnesses. This mistaken belief actually led doctors to contribute to the deaths of many of their patients. When we use flawed models we are more likely to misunderstand the situation, the variables that matter, and the cause and effect relationships between them. Because of such misunderstandings we often take suboptimal actions, like draining so much blood out of patients that they die from it.

> But we are not passive participants in our decisions. The world does not act on us as much as it reveals itself to us and we respond.

> When it comes to applying mental models we tend to run into trouble either when our model of reality is wrong, that is, it doesn’t survive real world experience, or when our model is right and we apply it to a situation where it doesn’t belong. 

> We compound the problem of flawed models when we fail to update our models when evidence indicates they are wrong. Only by repeated testing of our models against reality and being open to feedback can we update our understanding of the world and change our thinking. We need to look at the results of applying the model over the largest sample size possible to be able to refine it so that it aligns with how the world actually works.
