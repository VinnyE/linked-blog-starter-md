Becoming a published author requires strong writing skills (see: [[Strengthen your circle of competence with key practices]]), but that alone is not enough to guarantee one will attain the level of success enjoyed by J.K. Rowling. Factors like luck, chance, and other elements beyond our control often play a significant role in determining the level of success we achieve. By acknowledging this distinction, we can avoid being misled by stories that might oversimplify the path to success. Ultimately, while certain necessary conditions are crucial for achieving our goals, it is essential to recognize that these alone may not be sufficient, and factors like luck and chance can significantly impact our journey (see: [[The difference between necessary and sufficient conditions for success]].)

> We often make the mistake of assuming that having some necessary conditions in place means that we have all of the sufficient conditions in place for our desired event or effect to occur. The gap between the two is the difference between becoming a published author and becoming J.K. Rowling. Certainly you have to know how to write well to become either, but it isn’t sufficient to become a Rowling. This is somewhat obvious to most. What’s not obvious is that the gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control. Assume you wanted to make it into the Fortune 500. Capital is necessary, but not sufficient. Hard work is necessary, but not sufficient. Intelligence is necessary, but not sufficient. Billionaire success takes all of those things and more, plus a lot of luck. That’s a big reason that there’s no recipe.
