**The Role of Focus**
> My search for the essential principles lying at the hearts of and connecting chess, the martial arts, and in a broader sense the learning process, was inspired to a certain extent by Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I'll never forget a scene that would guide my approach to learning for years to come. The protagonist of Pirsig's story, a brilliant if eccentric man named Phaedrus, is teaching a rhetorical student who is all jammed up when given the assignment to write a five-hundred-word story about her town. She can't write a word. The town seems so small, so incidental–what could possible be interesting enough to write about? Phaedrus liberates the girl from her writer's block by changing the assignment. He asks her to write about the front of the opera house outside her classroom on a small street in a small neighborhood of that same dull town. She should begin with the upper-left hand brick. At first the student is incredulous, but then a torrent of creativity unleashes and she can't stop writing. The next day she comes to class with twenty inspired pages. – Josh Waitzkin, The Art of Learning

A successful learning journey requires a high degree of focus. A student unable to write about her entire town, as shown in the example, becomes prolific when asked to focus on a single brick of a single building. This anecdote illuminates the power of focusing on the seemingly insignificant details in unleashing our creativity and understanding.
