Bayesian thinking is a key concept in [[Probabalistic thinking]] that involves updating our beliefs based on new information while considering prior beliefs. This approach enables the usage of all relevant prior information when making decisions, leading to more accurate predictions and decisions. 

Bayesian thinking also accounts for the likelihood ratio or Bayes factor, which helps determine the probability of prior beliefs being true in light of new information.

> The core of Bayesian thinking (or Bayesian updating, as it can be called) is this: given that we have limited but useful information about the world, and are constantly encountering new information, we should probably take into account what we already know when we learn something new. As much of it as possible. Bayesian thinking allows us to use all relevant prior information in making decisions. Statisticians might call it a base rate, taking in outside information about past situations like the one you’re in

>  It is important to remember that priors themselves are probability estimates. For each bit of prior knowledge, you are not putting it in a binary structure, saying it is true or not. You’re assigning it a probability of being true. Therefore, you can’t let your priors get in the way of processing new knowledge. In Bayesian terms, this is called the likelihood ratio or the Bayes factor. Any new information you encounter that challenges a prior simply means that the probability of that prior being true may be reduced. Eventually some priors are replaced completely. This is an ongoing cycle of challenging and validating what you believe you know.
