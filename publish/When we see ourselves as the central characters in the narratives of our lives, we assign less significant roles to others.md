We naturally see ourselves as the central characters in the narratives of our lives, assigning less significant roles to others. This inward focus, a function of our hardwired self-attention, can skew our interactions with others towards our own feelings and reactions. It's important to recognize this tendency and strive towards a more balanced perspective, one that considers the feelings and needs of others too. 

[[The Ensemble Perspective]] is one solution.
