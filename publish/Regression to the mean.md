A critical concept that often gets overlooked in the context of [[Correlation vs Causation]] is the idea of regression to the mean. This statistical phenomenon signifies that over time, exceptionally high or low outcomes tend to move closer to the average. This means that the top performers might seem to deteriorate, and the worst performers may appear to improve, regardless of any additional interventions. This principle is commonly disregarded, even by trained scientists and the media, leading to misconstrued interpretations of causality (see: [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]]).

The principle of regression to the mean is particularly salient in the study of extreme groups, such as children with depression. Over time, these children will likely display an improvement in their depression scores, even without any specific interventions. This natural trend towards the mean is often misinterpreted as the result of a particular policy or treatment.

To discern genuine improvement from a natural regression to the mean, the introduction of a control group can be beneficial. The control group is expected to improve due to regression alone, and the goal is to determine whether the treated group shows an improvement beyond what can be attributed to regression. However, in real-world situations involving individual or team performances, introducing a control group can be challenging, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of regression. In such cases, comparisons can be made against industry averages, peer cohorts, or historical rates of improvement, although these measures are imperfect.

> Depressed children are an extreme group, they are more depressed than most other childrenâ€”and extreme groups regress to the mean over time. The correlation between depression scores on successive occasions of testing is less than perfect, so there will be regression to the mean: depressed children will get somewhat better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull.

> We often mistakenly attribute a specific policy or treatment as the cause of an effect, when the change in the extreme groups would have happened anyway. 

>  Luckily there is a way to tell between a real improvement and something that would have happened anyway. That is the introduction of the so-called control group, which is expected to improve by regression alone. The aim of the research is to determine whether the treated group improves more than regression can explain.

>  In real life situations with the performance of specific individuals or teams, where the only real benchmark is the past performance and no control group can be introduced, the effects of regression can be difficult if not impossible to disentangle. We can compare against industry average, peers in the cohort group or historical rates of improvement, but none of these are perfect measures
