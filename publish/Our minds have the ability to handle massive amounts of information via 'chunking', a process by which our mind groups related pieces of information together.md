**The Chunking Theory**
Our minds have a remarkable ability to handle massive amounts of information by 'chunking.' Chunking is the cognitive process by which our mind groups related pieces of information together. These information clusters are bound together by patterns or principles unique to a discipline. [[The more we navigate between 'chunks' of knowledge in our brain, the easier it becomes to access and recall that knowledge quickly, like carving paths through a jungle of information]]
