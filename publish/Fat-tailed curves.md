Fat-tailed curves is a concept within [[Probabalistic thinking]] that represent distributions with a higher probability of extreme events compared to bell curves, which have predictable extremities with limited deviation from the mean. 

> Think of it this way. In a bell curve type of situation, like displaying the distribution of height or weight in a human population, there are outliers on the spectrum of possibility, but the outliers have a fairly well-defined scope. You’ll never meet a man who is ten times the size of an average man. But in a curve with fat tails, like wealth, the central tendency does not work the same way. You may regularly meet people who are ten, 100, or 10,000 times wealthier than the average person. That is a very different type of world.

Adapting to fat-tailed distributions requires positioning oneself to survive or benefit from an unpredictable future by planning and adapting to a world that cannot be fully understood. Now, more than maybe any other time in history, the future is increasingly uncertain due to increasing AI advancements. To adapt to this, we must embrace [[Anti-fragility]].

> The difference is in the tails. In a bell curve the extremes are predictable. There can only be so much deviation from the mean. In a fat-tailed curve there is no real cap on extreme events.

> The more extreme events that are possible, the longer the tails of the curve get.

> The important thing is not to sit down and imagine every possible scenario in the tail (by definition, it is impossible) but to deal with fat-tailed domains in the correct way: by positioning ourselves to survive or even benefit from the wildly unpredictable future, by being the only ones thinking correctly and planning for a world we don’t fully understand.
