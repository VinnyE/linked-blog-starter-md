### Integration of Stress and Recovery into Everyday Life
The rhythm of "Stress and Recovery" should not be confined to training periods but integrated into all aspects of life. From reading a book to working at the office, taking short breaks to rest and rejuvenate can help maintain focus and productivity. These little moments of relaxation condition our minds and bodies to alternate between periods of exertion and tranquility.
