### Teacher as a Guide, Not an Authority
Effective teaching begins by tuning into the unique essence of each student. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach, good teachers understand and respect the individual learning style and natural voice of each student, nurturing their capabilities and their interest to keep moving forward.

A crucial role of a teacher is to maintain a balance in their students between discipline and passion, and between analysis and the absorption of facts and techniques. This balance promotes a joyful and passionate approach to learning, which is vital for long-term engagement and success.

Successful teachers foster an environment where students can carve their minds into maturity, imbuing them with a lifelong hunger for absorbing, processing, and applying knowledge effectively. This approach respects and nurtures the student's unique personality, creating a learning journey that is in harmony with who they are.
