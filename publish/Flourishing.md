Flourishing refers to an overarching essence or texture of life, defined by purpose, meaning, and dignity. It is the experience of fully living life, embracing not just physical comforts, but also intangible elements like integrity, purpose, and autonomy. This essence is more significant than transient pleasures or pains and defines us beyond our day-to-day experiences.

The ancient greeks referred to this state as [[Eudaemonia â€“ Beyond Happiness]]
