### Carved Neural Pathways
[[Our minds have the ability to handle massive amounts of information via 'chunking', a process by which our mind groups related pieces of information together]]. The process of creating chunks and navigating between them can be likened to carving paths through a jungle of information. As we repeatedly engage with a discipline, our mind effectively creates these paths, simplifying future navigation through the subject matter. The more we use these paths, the clearer and faster they become, allowing us to access, process, and recall information more swiftly.
