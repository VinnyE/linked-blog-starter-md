It is difficult to [[remote-blog/publish/Circle of competence]] when venturing into unfamiliar domains. When you've identified that you're operating in an area outside of your cicle of competence, it is essential to learn the basics and consult experts who possess a strong understanding of the domain. Asking detailed and thoughtful questions can help you gather valuable information and develop skills necessary for decision-making. Furthermore, using a broad understanding of mental models (see: [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]]) will allow you to identify foundational concepts that can guide you in these unfamiliar situations. This approach ensures that you can [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]] and make informed decisions even when faced with new challenges.

> There are three parts to successfully operating outside a circle of competence: Learn at least the basics of the realm you’re operating in, while acknowledging that you’re a Stranger, not a Lifer. However, keep in mind that basic information is easy to obtain and often gives the acquirer an unwarranted confidence. Talk to someone whose circle of competence in the area is strong. Take the time to do a bit of research to at least define questions you need to ask, and what information you need, to make a good decision. If you ask a person to answer the question for you, they’ll be giving you a fish. If you ask them detailed and thoughtful questions, you’ll learn how to fish. Furthermore, when you need the advice of others, especially in higher stakes situations, ask questions to probe the limits of their circles. Then ask yourself how the situation might influence the information they choose to provide you. Use a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your limited understanding of the field in which you find yourself a Stranger. These will help you identify the foundational concepts that would be most useful. These then serve as a guide to help you navigate the situation you are in
