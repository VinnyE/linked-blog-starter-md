When we reduce our blindspots, we get closer to reality. With reduced blindspots, we start to [[Overcome obstacles to learning from reality]]. This is why [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] is a good idea. Once we learn to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]], we start thinking better. Thinking better involves using simple processes to explore problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives. This ultimately leads to better decision-making and finding better solutions.

Finding the right solution for the right problem is a form of wisdom in itself. Even better though, as [[Charlie Munger]] has mentioned, [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]].

> In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins. Removing blind spots means we see, interact with, and move closer to understanding reality. We think better. And thinking better is about finding simple processes that help us work through problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives, allowing us to better choose solutions that fit what matters to us. The skill for finding the right solutions for the right problems is one form of wisdom.
