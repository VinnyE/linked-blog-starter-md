Human decisions are deeply rooted in the quest for meaningfulness. We often choose paths in life not solely based on [[Narrow utilitarianism]] benefits but based on what feels right, what aligns with our identity ([[We behave in ways that are consistent with our identity, even if the actions may not be immediately rewarding or beneficial]]) and sense of purpose. This drive often trumps the potentially negative implications of such decisions. Whether it's taking up a challenging job, having children, or deciding where to live, our choices often reflect a deep-seated desire to lead lives of meaning. This is [[The Path to Flourishing]].
