Creativity is the spark that leaps from the solid foundation of deeply internalized knowledge. It's about understanding the intricacies of your craft so well that they become second nature, opening the door for intuition to play its part. Consider it like building a pyramid; each level represents a chunk of technical knowledge, principles, patterns you've mastered. When a creative burst strikes, it's like discovering something hovering just above your pyramid. The challenge and joy lie in connecting this discovery back to what you know, dissecting the 'magic' to its technical roots. As we repeatedly digest and practice these knowledge chunks, they transition from conscious thought into the realm of the unconscious. Here, they interconnect, ready to manifest as sudden bursts of insight, transforming a once mathematical process into a flowing dance of intuition.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Foundation of Creativity
Creativity is not a standalone phenomenon but a function of deeply internalized knowledge. It's a leap that utilizes what we already know and pushes it a step or two further, resulting in novel discoveries.

### Building the Pyramid of Knowledge
The acquisition and internalization of knowledge can be likened to building a pyramid. Each level represents a set of technical information and principles, which, once mastered, leads us to the next level. When a creative burst occurs, it represents a new insight or discovery that is just beyond the current top of our pyramid of knowledge.

### Connecting Creativity to Knowledge
A critical aspect of the creative process involves tracing back a creative discovery to its roots in the existing knowledge. This involves breaking down the discovery into its technical components and understanding what makes it work—essentially figuring out the "magic" behind the insight.

### Transition from Numbers to Intuition
In the learning process, technical details and principles initially dominate our understanding. With time and practice, these details transition from being explicit numerical values to intuitive concepts. This shift allows for a more fluid understanding and application of the knowledge, enhancing our ability to make insightful leaps in the discipline.

### The Role of the Unconscious Mind
As we repeatedly digest and practice small chunks of knowledge, they move from the conscious mind to the unconscious mind. In the unconscious realm, these pieces of knowledge interconnect and can manifest as sudden bursts of intuitive insight. This high level of knowledge integration signifies a deep understanding of the discipline and paves the way for creative innovation.

> When I think about creativity, it is always in relation to a foundation. We have our knowledge. It becomes deeply internalized until we can access it without thinking about it. Then we have a leap that uses what we know to go one or two steps further. We make a discovery. Most people stop here and hope that they will become inspired and reach that state of “divine insight” again. In my mind, this is a missed opportunity. Imagine that you are building a pyramid of knowledge. Every level is constructed of technical information and principles that explain that information and condense it into chunks (as I explained in the chapter Slowing Down Time). Once you have internalized enough information to complete one level of the pyramid, you move on to the next. Say you are ten or twelve levels in. Then you have a creative burst like the ones Dan and I had in the ring. In that moment, it is as if you are seeing something that is suspended in the sky just above the top of your pyramid. There is a connection between that discovery and what you know—or else you wouldn’t have discovered it—and you can find that connection if you try. The next step is to figure out the technical components of your creation. Figure out what makes the “magic” tick.

> It is important to understand that by numbers to leave numbers, or form to leave form, I am describing a process in which technical information is integrated into what feels like natural intelligence. Sometimes there will literally be numbers. Other times there will be principles, patterns, variations, techniques, ideas. A good literal example of this process, one that does in fact involve numbers, is a beginner’s very first chess lesson. All chess players learn that the pieces have numerical equivalents—bishops and knights are worth three pawns, a rook is five pawns, a queen is nine. Novices are counting in their heads or on their fingers before they make exchanges. In time, they will stop counting. The pieces will achieve a more flowing and integrated value system. They will move across the board like fields of force. What was once seen mathematically is now felt intuitively.

> My numbers to leave numbers approach to chess study was my way of having a working relationship with the unconscious parts of my mind. I would take in vast amounts of technical information that my brain somehow put together into bursts of insight that felt more like music or wind than mathematical combinations. Increasingly, I had the sense that the key to these leaps was interconnectedness – some part of my being was harmonizing all my relevant knowledge, making it gel into one potent eruption, and suddenly the enigmatic was crystal-clear.

> By studying discrete pieces of information thoroughly and practicing their application repetitively, they eventually shed their technical, nitty-gritty character. This happens because  the process of digesting small chunks of knowledge over and over again shifts it from the conscious mind to the unconscious mind where it can connect with other chunks of internalized knowledge and manifest as the sudden burst of insight we experience as free-flowing intuition. This high level of knowledge integration is what we should aim for—it allows us to access what we have committed to learning in a fluid, precise, and improvisational manner. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/advanced-learning/numbers-to-leave-numbers/
