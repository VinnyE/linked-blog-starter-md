Effective storytelling isn't a straight path, but a zigzag journey full of unexpected turns and exciting moments, achieved through the powerful connective tissues of "but" and "therefore". Instead of telling a story that simply flows, great storytellers use these words or their synonyms to introduce change and keep the listener engaged. Additionally, storytelling often benefits from the use of negative statements, which subtly imply a binary choice and spark intrigue. This doesn't mean positive statements don't have their place - they can serve as concise, impactful answers to questions, or add an amusing twist to a narrative.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Connective Tissue of a Story: "But" and "Therefore"
Strong narratives are made up of sentences and scenes that do not simply follow one another in an unbroken chain. They change direction, introduce unexpected elements, and maintain momentum. This movement is signaled by the words "but" and "therefore", which indicate a twist or a consequence, respectively. These words keep the listener engaged and on their toes, eager to see where the story is heading next.

### Story as a Serrated Path
Instead of a linear recounting of events, great storytellers aim to create a serrated path that zigs and zags, offering changes in direction and surprising turns. This approach ensures that the story does not become predictable or flat, and instead captures the listener's attention with its dynamic twists and turns.

### The Power of Negatives in Storytelling
In storytelling, stating what something or someone is not can often be more impactful than stating what they are. Negative statements offer a subtle binary choice, introducing the potential for change and complexity in the story. They can imply a hidden "but", which teases at what could have been and sparks curiosity in the listener.

### The Role of Positive Statements
While negative statements are often favored in storytelling for their ability to introduce complexity, positive statements also have a key role to play. They can add a punchy conclusion to a scene or provide a simple, straightforward answer to a question. This straightforwardness helps to balance out the complexity introduced by negative statements and keeps the story grounded and clear.

### References

> The ideal connective tissue in any story are the words but and therefore, along with all their glorious synonyms. These buts and therefores can be either explicit or implied.
> 
> "And” stories have no movement or momentum. They are equivalent to running on a treadmill. Sentences and scenes appear, one after another, but the movement is straightforward and unsurprising. The momentum is unchanged. But and therefore are words that signal change. The story was heading in one direction, but now it’s heading in another. We started out zigging, but now we are zagging. We did this, and therefore this new thing happened. 
> 
> I think of it as continually cutting against the grain of the story. Rather than stretching a flat line from the beginning to end, the storyteller should seek to create a serrated line cutting back and forth, up and down, along the path of the story. We are still headed in the same direction, but the best storytellers don't take a straight line to get there.

> About a year after I stumbled upon this principle, a student directed me to an online video of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators and writers of South Park. They had joined a college writing class at NYU and described stumbling upon this principle as well. Parker and Stone explained that as they storyboard each scene in their show, they have found that they must be able to connect the scenes (they refer to them as beats) with a but or a therefore for the next scene to work. If the words and then can be placed between any two scenes, Parker says, “You’re fucked.” Matt Stone says it’s this “causation between each scene that makes a story.” This happens, therefore that happens, but then this happens, therefore that happens.
> 
> Stone is right. It's the causation, or the causal links between sentences, paragraphs, and scenes that make a story. It's the interconnectedness of moments that brings meaning to an otherwise linear collection of events connected only by time and space. 
> 
> Stories are not a simple recounting of events. They are not a thorough reporting of moments over a given period of time. Stories are the crafted representation of events that are related in such a way to demonstrate change over time in the life of the teller.
> 
> One other aspect to the but-and-therefore principle: the power of the negative. Oddly, the negative is almost always better than the positive when it comes to storytelling. Saying what something or someone is not is almost always better than saying what something or someone is. For example:
> 
> "I am dumb, ugly, and unpopular."
> "I'm not smart, I'm not at all good-looking, and no one likes me."
> 
> The second sentence is better, isn't it? Here's why: it contains a hidden *but*. It presents both possibilities. Unlike the first sentence, which only offers single descriptors, the second sentence offers a binary. It presents the potential of being smart and not smart, good-looking and not good-looking, popular and unpopular. The second sentence really says this: I could be smart, but I'm dumb. I could be good-looking, but I'm ugly. By saying what I am not, I am also saying what I could have been, and that is a hidden but. 
> 
> This isn't always true, of course. A short, positive statement at the end of a paragraph of description can often serve as an amusing button to a scene.

> "Heather laughed at me when I wasn’t trying to be funny. She refused my offer of a birthday cupcake, claiming she’d already had a cupcake that day, even though it was only 9:30 AM. She chose to walk five miles home from school, even though I offered her a ride and she lived next door to me. Heather despised me."
> 
> But did you notice the three sentences before that last one? Each one of them contained an implied hidden but. 
> 
> "Heather laughed at me when (but) I wasn’t trying to be funny. She refused my offer of a birthday cupcake, claiming she’d already had a cupcake that day, even though (but) it was only 9:30 AM. She chose to walk five miles home from school, even though (but) I offered her a ride and she lived next door to me.""
> 
> Simple, positive statements are also preferred when answering questions. In answer to the question, “Who is Heather?” a statement like “my ex-girlfriend” is more effective than “She was once my girlfriend.” Short answers to simple questions should never feel dramatic or crafted.
