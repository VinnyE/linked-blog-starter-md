In the context of human history, it is important to recognize the distinction between trends and fundamental laws. While certain laws of human biology can be identified and understood, historical trends are subject to change due to varying conditions. Bertrand Russell's example of the chicken being fed every day illustrates this point. The chicken believes the feedings are a guaranteed part of its life, mistaking a trend for a law. However, the feedings abruptly end when the chicken is slaughtered, revealing the trend as a poor predictor of future events. This example demonstrates that trends do not necessarily determine destiny (something [[Karl Popper]] also believed thanks to applying his [[The principle of Falsifiability in Science]]).

>  Here we hit on the problem of trying to assert any fundamental laws by which human history must inevitably progress. Trend is not destiny. Even if we can derive and understand certain laws of human biological nature, the trends of history itself are dependent on conditions, and conditions change. Bertrand Russellâ€™s classic example of the chicken that gets fed every day is a great illustration of this concept. Daily feedings have been going on for as long as the chicken has observed, and thus it supposes that these feedings are a guaranteed part of its life and will continue in perpetuity. The feedings appear as a law until the day the chicken gets its head chopped off. They are then revealed to be a trend, not a predictor of the future state of affairs.
