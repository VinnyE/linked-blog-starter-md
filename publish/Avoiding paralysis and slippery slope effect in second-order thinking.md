title: "Avoiding paralysis and slippery slope effect in second-order thinking"

[[Second-order thinking for holistic decision making]] must be balanced to avoid the slippery slope effect, wherein we become paralyzed by the fear of potential consequences. We've been seeing some of this at play recently with AI doomers who are afraid that we wont be able to align AGI and they'll end up wiping out humanity. 

Instead, we should focus on the most likely outcomes and use our practical judgment to evaluate our actions. Second-order thinking needs to evaluate the most likely effects and their most likely consequences, checking our understanding of what the typical results of our actions will be. If we worried about all possible effects of effects of our actions, we would likely never do anything, and we’d be wrong. As Garrett Hardin mentions in Filters Against Folly:

> Those who take the wedge (Slippery Slope) argument with the utmost seriousness act as though they think human beings are completely devoid of practical judgment. Countless examples from everyday life show the pessimists are wrong. If we took the wedge argument seriously, we would pass a law forbidding all vehicles to travel at any speed greater than zero. That would be an easy way out of the moral problem. But we pass no such law.

> Being aware of second-order consequences and using them to guide your decision-making may mean the short term is less spectacular, but the payoffs for the long term can be enormous. By delaying gratification now, you will save time in the future. You won’t have to clean up the mess you made on account of not thinking through the effects of your short-term desires.

> A word of caution: Second-order thinking, as valuable as it is, must be tempered in one important way: You can’t let it lead to the paralysis of the Slippery Slope Effect, the idea that if we start with action A, everything after is a slippery slope down to hell, with a chain of consequences B, C, D, E, and F.
