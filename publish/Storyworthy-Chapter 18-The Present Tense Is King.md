The art of storytelling is not just about recounting past events but about skillfully manipulating time to engage the reader. Using the present tense, a storyteller can create a sense of immediacy, drawing the reader into the narrative and making them feel as though they are experiencing the events alongside the narrator. However, it's vital to shift between tenses strategically. While the present tense can make a narrative feel immediate and urgent, the past tense can provide necessary context, offering a sense of perspective and distance. A past event related in the present tense can amplify its emotional impact, while shifting to the past tense when sharing backstory can preserve the story's temporal continuity. The choice between past and present tense should be deliberate, taking into account the emotional gravity of each moment and the desired level of audience engagement. The mastery of this narrative dance, shifting seamlessly from past to present, is a key component of compelling storytelling.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Power of the Present Tense
The present tense in storytelling can create a sense of immediacy and urgency. It pulls the reader into the narrative, making them feel as though they are experiencing events alongside the storyteller. It acts like a temporal magnet, drawing the reader into the specific time and place of the story.

### Strategic Tense Shifting
Strategic shifting between tenses is a powerful tool in storytelling. Shifting from the present to the past tense can provide necessary context and offer a sense of perspective and distance. Conversely, relating a past event in the present tense can amplify its emotional impact.

### Backstory and Past Tense
When sharing backstory or providing context, using the past tense can help maintain the story's temporal continuity. It can also make sense to the reader, as they naturally associate the past tense with past events.

### Choice of Tense and Emotional Impact
The choice of tense in storytelling should be deliberate and tailored to the emotional gravity of each moment. Using the present tense for emotionally charged moments can heighten their impact, while using the past tense for backstory can keep the reader grounded in the story's timeline.

### Visualizing the Story
Seeing the story as you tell it can enhance your connection to it and make it more engaging for the reader. By vividly picturing the events you're describing, you can align your current emotional state with the emotions you experienced at that time, making the story more authentic and relatable.

> Another strategy that I’m using to put you on this train with me is the use of the present tense. These events are happening right now for me, literally as I write this sentence, and, I hope, you feel as if they are happening in the space and time that you are occupying as you read these words. This is the magic of the present tense. It creates a sense of immediacy. Even though you are reading these words in bed or by the light of a roaring fire or perhaps naked in your bathtub, a part of you, maybe, is on this train with me, staring at a little boy who desperately needs to pee. The present tense acts like a temporal magnet, sucking you into whatever time I want you to occupy. It allows me to put you on an Amtrak train somewhere in central New Jersey in the summer of 2017 or in my 1976 Chevy Malibu on a lonely highway in New Hampshire in the fall of 1991 or in a chaotic emergency room on December 23, 1988. The present tense will bring you a little closer to these moments in time. It may even trick you into believing that you have time traveled back in time to these moments.

> Did you see what I did there? I opened that section in the present tense again, but then I shifted to the past tense when I slipped into backstory about the day I taught Charlie how to pee on the tree. I did this deliberate, for two reasons:

> 1. I didn’t want to compromise the immediacy of the train part by bringing in a second present tense to my story. If I spoke about Charlie’s tree-peeing lesson in the present tense as well, then I would risk diluting the visceral, present-tense nature of the train. Stories cannot have two or more events that took place at different times happen in the present time of the story. It’s like putting a hat on a hat.
> 2. The use of the past tense in backstory makes sense. It’s in the past. It should be presented as such. This is not always the case, but it’s often the case. When in doubt, tell backstory using the past tense. 
> 
> Following the tree-peeing backstory, I end that last section by returning you to the present tense. I placed you back on the train, walking down the aisle, passing the woman with the knowing glance after another failed attempt.

> There are other reasons to shift tenses when telling a story. Sometimes I want to push an audience back before bringing them forward again. Even though I might be relation information from the past, I still want the past event told in the present tense. I do this because it's a powerful moment in the story. It means a lot to me, and I hope it will mean a lot to my audience. I want them to feel as if it's happening in the present. I want them to see teenagers calling teenagers, rushing to my assistance while my parents go to check on the car first.

> I can’t tell you about this phone tree when it’s actually happening, because it would ruin the surprise of my friends in the waiting room, so I tell you about it after it has happened — but in the present tense. While these time shifts were admittedly intentional, many are not. As you begin to tell stories in the present tense, the shift from present to past to present will become instinctual as you learn to sense when you want your audience in the present moment as opposed to the past. I hit a moment of heightened emotion or increased gravity, so I instinctually shift to the present tense if I’m not already there, because this is when I want my audience “in the now.” Similarly, when I launch into backstory, I almost always instinctually shift into the past tense. It just makes sense.

> When she was editing The Moth’s collection of stories, Catherine Burns told me that she discovered that storytellers shift tenses constantly, but it’s not something you would notice unless you’re trying to put these stories on the page. These constant tense shifts are nearly undetectable in their oral versions. But on the page, they become obvious and

> Seeing your story as you tell it is a great thing. It will help you connect to it more effectively. Your emotional state will more closely match your actual emotions from the time and place that you are describing. When you can see your story, it is more likely that your audience will see your story too.

> Some things are told better from a distance. Urination, I think, is one of them. But then I switched to the present tense when I admitted to crying in the restroom, because in that moment, I wanted you as close to me as possible. But the important part is this: I made the choice. I weighed my options. I didn't simply default to one tense. I chose what I thought was the correct tense for that particular moment.

> There is nothing wrong with telling a story from the past – even five minutes in the past – using the past tense. You will not be a terrible storyteller if you do. In a lot of ways, this is the most intuitive, logical, and expected way to talk about the past. It makes a lot of sense.
