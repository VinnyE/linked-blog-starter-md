### Sunk Costs and The Redefinition of Mistakes
Sunk costs are expenses that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. They should not dictate future actions or decisions. Similarly, life choices that didn't turn out as hoped should not be seen as mistakes but as experiences that have shaped our journey. As seen in Bill Belichick's strategy, if an 'adventure' doesn't cost much to end, it's worth exploring. We're encouraged to redefine our understanding of mistakes and sunk costs, enabling us to approach life with an adventurous spirit.
