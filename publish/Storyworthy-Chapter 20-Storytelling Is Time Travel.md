In the art of storytelling, the storyteller's task is akin to that of a time traveler, whisking listeners away from their current reality and immersing them in a world of the past. To successfully achieve this, storytellers must carefully craft their narrative to maintain the illusion of time travel, ensuring that the listener remains in the story's temporal and spatial setting. This involves avoiding practices that could break the story's spell, such as asking rhetorical questions, addressing the audience directly, using props, or introducing anachronisms. Storytellers should also refrain from mentioning that they're telling a story, as this can shatter the illusion. Lastly, the storyteller's physical presence should be downplayed to prevent any distractions from the narrative. Through adherence to these practices, the story can serve as a portal, transporting the audience to another place and time.

## Concept Breakdown

### Storytelling as Time Travel
Effective storytelling can transport listeners to a different time and place, immersing them so deeply in the narrative that they momentarily forget their present reality. This concept, likened to time travel, is central to engaging storytelling.

### Avoiding Rhetorical Questions and Direct Address
To maintain the illusion of time travel, storytellers should avoid asking rhetorical questions or directly addressing the audience, as these practices pull listeners out of the narrative and back into their current reality.

### The Harm of Props
Props can disrupt the immersive experience of a story by drawing attention to the present physical reality. As such, they should be avoided to maintain the illusion of time travel.

### Anachronisms in Storytelling
Introducing elements that are temporally out of place, or anachronisms, can break the illusion of time travel in a story. While sometimes necessary to explain the context to a newer generation, they should be used sparingly.

### Not Mentioning 'Story' in Your Story
Using phrases that remind listeners that they're hearing a story can break the illusion of time travel. To maintain this illusion, storytellers should avoid mentioning that they're telling a story.

### Downplaying Physical Presence
To enhance the immersive experience of a story, the storyteller should aim to become a 'disembodied voice', downplaying their physical presence to prevent distractions from the narrative.

> In its best form, storytelling is time travel. If I am doing my job well and telling an excellent story, you may, for just a moment, forget that you exist in the present time and space and travel back to the year and location that I am describing. My goal as a storyteller is to make my audience forget that the present moment exists. I want them to forget that I exist. I want their mind’s eye to be filled with images of the movie I am creating in their brains. I want this movie to transport them back to the year and spot that my story takes place. If a storyteller is performing well, and if the conditions are right, I think this magic can happen. I believe that audiences — in theaters, in boardrooms, or at dinner tables — can be transported back into the past. It’s admittedly easier to achieve this form of time travel if the conditions are just right. Lights turned down. Comfortable chair. Silence. Perhaps even a glass of wine or beer in the bellies of your audience members. This is why movie theaters are designed the way they are. Filmmakers want you to forget that you’re watching fiction. They want you to laugh and cry and worry about people who are pretending to be other people in a story that never actually happened.

> But it's a fragile bubble. It can be popped easily. It doesn't take much. Storytellers must be careful if they don't want to ruin any time-traveling magic that they might muster. Here are some rules to avoid popping this mystical bubble:

##### Don’t ask rhetorical questions.
> Actors in movies never ask rhetorical questions of their audience (Ferris Bueller's Day Off being the only exception I have found so far), and neither should you. Asking a rhetorical question causes the audience to devise an answer in their mind. You have just turned your story into a Q&A session. You’ve reminded them that you exist, they exist, and this moment that you and they are occupying exists. 

##### Don’t address the audience or acknowledge their existence whatsoever.
> Avoid phrases like "You guys!" for the same reason you shouldn't ask rhetorical questions. When a storyteller says something like "You guys, you're not going to believe this!" the bubble is instantly broken. Time travel has abruptly ended. The audience is keenly aware that someone is standing in front of them, speaking directly to them and the people sitting around them. 
> 
> If someone in the audience shouts in approval, say nothing and do nothing. We disregard fools in the hope that our lack of recognition will cause them to cease acting foolish in the future. 

##### No props. Ever.
> Don't use props. They never help. Even worse, they always hurt.

##### Avoid anachronisms.
> An anachronism is a thing that is set in a period other than that in which it exists. It’s a microwave in the Middle Ages. A refrigerator during the Renaissance. The internet during the Inquisition.
> 
> If you’re telling a story about something that happened in 1960, but at some point you say that your mission was as unlikely as the moon landing, you’ve created a temporal impossibility in the story and likely popped your time-traveling bubble. Anachronisms are like sledgehammers, reminding us that this story is just a story. It reinforces the idea that we are not traveling through time. But sometimes they're unavoidable, for example to explain to a newer generation the lack of existence of say a cell phone in a story based in 1990. 

##### Don’t mention the word story in your story.
> Phrases like, “But that’s a story for another day,” or “Long story short” serve to remind our audience that we are telling a story. If your audience knows that you’re telling a story, then they’re not time traveling.

##### Downplay your physical presence as much as possible. 
> My goal is to downplay my physical presence. I want to increase the likelihood of becoming a disembodied voice in the mind of my audience. I want them to completely forget that I’m standing in front of them. Just don’t wear clothing that might upstage you or attract the audience’s attention during your story.
