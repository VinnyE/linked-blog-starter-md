Probabilistic thinking is a powerful mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) that employs mathematical and logical principles to estimate the likelihood of specific outcomes. It enables more precise and effective decisions in a complex world and forms the foundation for understanding key concepts such as [[Bayesian thinking]] and [[Conditional probability]]. 

It's important to remember that Probabalistic thinking doesn't guarentee 100% success, but it can get you in the ballpark. 

Three important concepts needed to understand probabalistic thinking are:
- [[Bayesian thinking]]
- [[Fat-tailed curves]]
- [[Asymmetries]]

> Probabilistic thinking is essentially trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass. It is one of the best tools we have to improve the accuracy of our decisions. In a world where each moment is determined by an infinitely complex set of factors, probabilistic thinking helps us identify the most likely outcomes. When we know these our decisions can be more precise and effective.
