title: "The true value of comprehension emerges when it leads to meaningful changes in our actions and behavior"

It's not what you know that's important, it's what you do with what you know. We can consume a limitless amount of content via books, articles, and videos. But knowledge only becomes useful when our actions and behaviors change as a result. 

Our ego often gets in the way of making these meaningful changes (see: [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]].)

> Understanding only becomes useful when we adjust our behavior and actions accordingly. The Great Models are not just theory. They are actionable insights that can be used to effect positive change in your life. What good is it to know that you constantly interrupt people if you fail to adjust your behavior in light of this? In fact, if you know and don’t change your behavior it often has a negative effect. People around you will tell themselves the simplest story that makes sense to them given what they see: that you just don’t care. Worse still, because you understand that you interrupt people, you’re surprised when you get the same results over and over. Why? You’ve failed to reflect on your new understanding and adjust your behavior. In the real world you will either understand and adapt to find success or you will fail.
