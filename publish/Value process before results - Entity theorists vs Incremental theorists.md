The manner in which an individual perceives intelligence significantly influences their capacity to learn, evolve, and master new material. This is underpinned by the contrast between the entity and incremental theories of intelligence, as defined by Dr. Carol Dweck, a distinguished developmental psychologist. Entity theorists consider intelligence as a fixed and inalterable trait, attributing their success or failure to this innate level of ability. On the other hand, incremental theorists perceive intelligence as a quality that can be developed over time through sustained effort, recognizing the role of hard work in achieving success and overcoming challenges.

Dweck's findings reveal that those who hold an incremental theory of intelligence, also referred to as learning theorists, exhibit a greater propensity to confront and overcome complex material. In contrast, entity theorists tend to be more fragile in the face of challenging situations, often leading to early surrender. For instance, when presented with difficult math problems, learning theorists showed excitement and determination, while entity theorists displayed discouragement. Following this challenge, it was noted that the entity theorists even struggled with tasks they had previously completed with ease, highlighting the detrimental effects of a fixed mindset on self-confidence.

Importantly, these differing approaches to learning are not inherently associated with levels of intelligence. Even highly intelligent individuals who subscribe to the entity theory can exhibit frailty when faced with challenges, as the pressure to maintain a perfect image becomes overwhelming. Factors such as parenting and teaching styles can greatly influence the development of these theories. For instance, children who are praised or criticized based on outcomes rather than efforts tend to become entity theorists. Conversely, emphasizing the process of learning fosters an incremental theory of intelligence.

The manner in which we perceive intelligence and learning can fundamentally impact our daily lives and the pursuit of excellence. Embracing a long-term, organic learning process paves the way for growth and evolution, often at the expense of temporary comfort or safety. This can be likened to the growth process of a hermit crab, which must abandon its familiar shell to find a larger one as it grows, despite the inherent risks.

People who aspire for success and excellence are often those who learn valuable lessons from their endeavors, regardless of the immediate outcome. The ability to glean wisdom from all experiences, positive or negative, is key to progress and contentment. This approach also equips individuals to maintain a long-term perspective, even in challenging circumstances. Moreover, the perception of intelligence and learning can influence performance in various fields. Whether in sports, arts, or business, a fixed mindset can hinder progress and the ability to learn from setbacks. On the other hand, an incremental approach promotes resilience, continuous learning, and ultimately, the pursuit of excellence.

Note: While it's important to value process before results, we should not use this an excuse to avoid ever putting ourselves on the line for something and risk failure. We must still make an [[Investment in loss]].

> Developmental psychologists have done extensive research on the effects of a student’s approach on his or her ability to learn and ultimately master material. Dr. Carol Dweck, a leading researcher in the field of developmental psychology, makes the distinction between entity and incremental theories of intelligence. Children who are “entity theorists”—that is, kids who have been influenced by their parents and teachers to think in this manner—are prone to use language like “I am smart at this” and to attribute their success or failure to an ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see their overall intelligence or skill level at a certain discipline to be a fixed entity, a thing that cannot evolve. Incremental theorists, who have picked up a different modality of learning—let’s call them learning theorists—are more prone to describe their results with sentences like “I got it because I worked very hard at it” or “I should have tried harder.” A child with a learning theory of intelligence tends to sense that with hard work, difficult material can be grasped—step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master.

> Dweck’s research has shown that when challenged by difficult material, learning theorists are far more likely to rise to the level of the game, while entity theorists are more brittle and prone to quit. Children who associate success with hard work tend to have a “mastery-oriented response” to challenging situations, while children who see themselves as just plain “smart” or “dumb,” or “good” or “bad” at something, have a “learned helplessness orientation.” In one wonderfully revealing study, a group of children was interviewed and then each child was noted as having either an entity or learning theory of intelligence. All the children were then given a series of easy math problems, which they all solved correctly. Then, all the children were given some very hard problems to solve—problems that were too difficult for them. It was clear that the learning theorists were excited by the challenge, while the entity theorists were dismayed. Comments would range from “Oh boy, now I’m really gonna have to try hard” to “I’m not smart enough for this.” Everyone got these problems wrong—but evidently the experience of being challenged had very different effects. What is most interesting is the third stage of this experiment: all the children were once again given easy problems to solve. Nearly all of the learning theorists breezed right through the easy material, but the entity theorists had been so dispirited by the inability to solve the hard problems that many of them foundered through the easy stuff. Their self-confidence had been destroyed.

> What is compelling about this is that the results have nothing to do with intelligence level. Very smart kids with entity theories tend to be far more brittle when challenged than kids with learning theories who would be considered not quite as sharp. In fact, some of the brightest kids prove to be the most vulnerable to becoming helpless, because they feel the need to live up to and maintain a perfectionist image that is easily and inevitably shattered. As an observer of countless talented young chess players, I can vouch for the accuracy of this point—some of the most gifted players are the worst under pressure, and have the hardest time rebounding from defeat.

> How are these theories of intelligence programmed into our minds? Often subtle differences in parental or instructional style can make a huge difference. Entity theorists tend to have been told that they did well when they have succeeded, and that they weren’t any good at something when they have failed. So a kid aces a math test, comes home, and hears “Wow, that’s my boy! As smart as they come!” Then, next week Johnny fails an English test and hears “What’s wrong with you? Can’t you read?” or “Your Mommy never liked reading either—obviously, it’s not your thing.” So the boy figures he’s good at math and bad at English, and what’s more, he links success and failure to ingrained ability. Learning theorists, on the other hand, are given feedback that is more process-oriented. 

> It is clear that parents and teachers have an enormous responsibility in forming the theories of intelligence of their students and children–and it is never too late. It is critical to realize that we can always evolve in our approaches to learning. Studies have shown that in just minutes, kids can be conditioned into having a healthy learning theory for a given situation. 

> So how does this affect us in our day-to-day lives? Fundamentally. The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity. Usually, growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety. The hermit crab is a colorful example of a creature that lives by this aspect of the growth process (albeit without our psychological baggage). As the crab gets bigger, it needs to find a more spacious shell. So the slow, lumbering creature goes on a quest for a new home. If an appropriate new shell is not found quickly, a terribly delicate moment of truth arises. A soft creature that is used to protection of built-in armor must now go out into the world, exposed to predators in all its mushy vulnerability. That learning phase between shells is where our growth can spring from. Someone stuck with an entity theory of intelligence is like an anorexic hermit crab, starving itself so it doesn't grow to have to find a new shell. 

> In my experience, successful people shoot for the stars, put their hearts on the line in every battle, and ultimately discover that the lessons learned from the pursuit of excellence mean much more than the immediate trophies and glory. In the long run, painful losses may prove much more valuable than wins—those who are armed with a healthy attitude and are able to draw wisdom from every experience, “good” or “bad,” are the ones who make it down the road. They are also the ones who are happier along the way. Of course the real challenge is to stay in range of this long-term perspective when you are under fire and hurting in the middle of the war. This, maybe our biggest hurdle, is the at the core of the art of learning. 

> The issue is fundamental to the pursuit of excellence in all fields. If a young basketball player is taught that winning is the only thing that winners do, then he will crumble when he misses his first big shot. If a gymnast or ballet dancer is taught that her self-worth is entirely wrapped up in a perfectly skinny body that is always ready for performance, then how can she handle injuries or life after an inevitably short career? If a businessperson cultivates a perfectionist self-image, then how can she learn from her mistakes?
