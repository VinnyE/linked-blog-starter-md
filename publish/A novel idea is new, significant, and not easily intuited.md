Novel ideas a form of non-obvious writing. You find them when you pursue your curiosity and note the things that interest and surprise you. If it's interesting to you, it's likely your readers will find it interesting as well. Novelty leads to dopamine spike. 

> A novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and _*worthwhile*_. I've identified five categories:
> 
> • **Counter-intuitive** — "Oh, I never realized the world worked that way."
> • **Counter-narrative** — "Wow, that's not how I was told the world worked!"
> • **Shock and awe** — "That's crazy. I would have never believed it."
> • **Elegant articulations** — "Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself."
> • **Make someone feel seen** — "Yes! That's exactly how I feel!"
