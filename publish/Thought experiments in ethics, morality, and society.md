[[Thought experiments]] are invaluable when exploring ethical and moral issues, as they allow us to consider the implications of different actions without causing real harm. For instance, philosopher John Rawls' concept of the "veil of ignorance" encourages us to think about designing a fair society by imagining ourselves in a position where we lack information about our social status, ethnicity, or gender. Overall, thought experiments facilitate a deeper understanding of various concepts and enable us to [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]].

When you are dealing with questions of life and death it is obviously not recommended to kill a bunch of people in order to determine the most ethical course of action. This then is where a thought experiment is also extremely valuable

> “veil of ignorance” proposed by philosopher John Rawls in his influential Theory of Justice. In order to figure out the most fair and equitable way to structure society, he proposed that the designers of said society operate behind a veil of ignorance. This means that they could not know who they would be in the society they were creating. If they designed the society without knowing their economic status, their ethnic background, talents and interests, or even their gender, they would have to put in place a structure that was as fair as possible in order to guarantee the best possible outcome for themselves.
