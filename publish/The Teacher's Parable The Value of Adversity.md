>  There is a parable of the teacher who gives a student a challenge: Here is a stone. Here is a tower with one hundred stairs to the top. Your job is to bring the stone to the top of the tower. Cradling the heavy stone, the student manages to get it to the door of the tower. But the door is very narrow and the stone is too wide. No matter how the student turns the stone, it cannot fit through the door. The task you have given me is impossible, cries the student. The teacher takes a hammer and cracks the stone open so that the pieces all fit easily through the door. The stone is your heart, says the teacher. Only a broken heart can rise upward. As we get older, we understand that the pain we have endured, especially heartbreak, hasnâ€™t just made us stronger. It has made everything we experience richer and fuller. As we get older, we come to prefer bittersweet chocolate to chocolate that is merely sweet.

The parable symbolizes that adversity, symbolized by a broken heart, can lead to growth and ascent. Endured pain, especially heartbreak, enhances our experiences, making them richer and fuller.
