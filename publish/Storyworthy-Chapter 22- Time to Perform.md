In this chapter, the Matthew Dicks enlightens us about the art of storytelling and performing, reminding us that a dash of nervousness can be advantageous, linking us to the audience by showcasing our vulnerability and authenticity. Instead of memorizing the stories, he recommends remembering key aspects like the opening lines, the conclusion, and the scenes, which bring the narrative alive. He also suggests the importance of eye contact, using three persons as guides - one on the left, one on the right, and one in the middle, to engage the entire audience. Moreover, to manage intense emotions during storytelling, he advises shifting the perspective from a subjective view to an objective standpoint. Finally, he underscores the importance of mastering the microphone to control the auditory experience of the audience.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Power of Nervousness
Every performer has a hint of stage fright, which surprisingly, is a good thing. Nervousness makes us appear more human and authentic to our audience, bridging the gap between the stage and the seats. It signifies our emotional investment and can be charming in settings like storytelling, first dates, job interviews, or delivering a toast, where the personal connection with the audience is crucial.

### The Art of Remembering a Story
Unlike actors who memorize their lines, a storyteller should remember the key parts of their narrative. These are the starting lines to hook the audience, the ending lines for a strong finish, and the scenes that form the backbone of the story. Having this skeletal framework ensures you can narrate the story effectively, even if you forget the specific words you had prepared.

### Making Eye Contact
Eye contact is a powerful tool to establish a connection with the audience. To make the task less daunting, pick three individuals - one on the left, one on the right, and one in the center who seem engaged in your storytelling. Direct your gaze towards them during your performance, which will give the impression of attending to the entire audience.

### Managing Emotions
Emotions are integral to storytelling, but they can overwhelm the narrative if not controlled. As the moment of heightened emotion approaches, switch your perspective from a subjective view to an objective standpoint. This shift allows you to express the emotional intensity without getting consumed by it.

### Mastering the Microphone
The microphone is the storyteller's wand that controls the auditory experience of the audience. Knowing how to use it proficiently is essential to ensure your voice, the carrier of your story, is heard loud and clear.

> Steve stopped me as I walked back to my seat and said, “You know what your problem is?” I had never spoken to my hero before, so I was flummoxed. “No?” I managed. “You’re not nervous up there, so you have to have a great story every time.” Steve said other things to me that night. Kind and generous things. Things that made me feel as if I was on top of the world. Today I’m proud to call him my friend. But that night in The Bell House, I knew almost instantly that Steve was right. When Steve performs, he is nervous. Backstage, he paces and mumbles to himself. Onstage, he is jittery and uncertain for the first few moments of his story, despite his honest-to-goodness greatness. His nervousness serves him well. Audiences love Steve before he even says a word. Every person in an audience wants to be on the stage to some degree. Maybe it’s less than 1 percent of their being that wants to perform, and maybe it’s 99 percent. Whatever the percentage, Steve connects with the audience before he even speaks, because through his nervousness, he shows them that he is just like them.

> The lesson here: Nervousness can be your friend. Too much of it is never good, but not being nervous at all isn’t good either. I bristle at the saying, “If you’re not nervous, you don’t care enough,” because I couldn’t care more about performing well, but there is some truth in this statement. It ain’t always bad to be nervous. 
> 
> There are moments, of course, when nervousness won’t help you. If you are presenting at a professional conference, pitching or selling a product, delivering the State of the Union address, or teaching high-school seniors, nervousness will not be perceived well. When you are supposed to be the expert or the authority, confidence is often required. But performing onstage? Talking to a girl on a first date? Delivering a wedding toast? Even a job interview? A little bit of nervousness is fine. Helpful, even. It’s endearing. It shows how much you care. It bridges the gap between you and your audience. 
> 
> When it's time to perform, here are some other helpful hints that will you well, whether you're telling a story at your uncle's funeral, your mother's fifth wedding, your high-school graduation, your dream job interview, or the Moth.

##### Don’t memorize your story.
> Actors are required to memorize their lines. You are not, nor should you.
> 
> Instead of memorizing your story word-for-word, memorize three parts to a story:
> 1. The first few sentences. Always start strong.
> 2. The last few sentences. Always end strong.
> 3. The scenes of your story.
> 
> If you’re following my advice and placing every moment of your story in a physical location (chapter 11), then your story will be composed of scenes: places where the action, dialogue, and internal monologues are taking place. If you remember these places, you will remember what happens there, even if every prepared word of your story suddenly flees your mind.
> 
> I try not to have more than seven scenes in a story. The phone company uses seven digits in our phone numbers because they determined that seven bits of information is the most that the average person can retain at one time. 

##### Make eye contact.
> My suggestion is this: Find a person on your left, a person on your right, and a person dead center who likes you. These will be the people who are smiling. Nodding. Laughing. Use these three people as your guideposts. Make eye contact with them, and the people in each of those areas will feel you are attending to them as well. 

##### Control your emotions.
> When I was a kid, I played video games in arcades. One of these games was a car-racing game. I would sit behind the wheel and race against other players behind other wheels. The game had an A and a B button to the left of the gearshift. If you pressed the A button, the screen displayed the road as a driver would see it through the windshield. If you pressed the B button, your perspective shifted to outside and above the car, looking down upon it.
> As the moment of heightened emotion approaches in a story, I press the B button. I shift my perspective from seeing my story through my eyes to seeing my story from above. Rather than watching my friends appear in that doorway, I watch a wounded boy see his friends standing in that doorway. I am still emotional in that moment, but not nearly as emotional as I would be if I relived the experience through my own eyes. 
> 
> There's also nothing wrong with becoming emotional during storytelling as long as your emotion doesn't overwhelm your craft.
