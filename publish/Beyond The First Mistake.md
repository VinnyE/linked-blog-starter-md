In the book “The Art Of Learning” by Josh Waitzkin, Josh shares a story that reminds me of the importance of presence and clarity of mind.

One fall afternoon in New York City, Josh was strolling east along 33rd Street, lost in thought on his way to P.S. 116, where he taught young students chess. If you’ve been to Manhattan, you know how hectic the city can be. With all the sirens, car horns, and people rushing around, it’s important to be alert, especially when crossing streets.

Deep in thought about his upcoming lesson, Josh stood at the crosswalk waiting for the signal to change. While waiting, he noticed a pretty young woman standing a few feet away from him, wearing headphones, moving to the beat of the music, lost in her own world. All of a sudden, she stepped into the busy traffic, appearing disoriented by the hectic one-way street as she looked the wrong way down Broadway.

Immediately, as she stepped forward down the curb, looking right, a bicycle approached from her left side. Managing his best to maneuver away, the bicyclist gave her a light bump. Here, Josh says, she could have walked away unscathed if she had stepped back onto the pavement.

Instead, she turned and yelled at the bicyclist.

As she faced away from the traffic, scolding the cyclist who had tried hard to avoid hitting her, a fast-moving taxi turned the corner.

The taxicab struck the woman from behind, sending her flying ten feet into the air and smashing into a lamppost, knocking her unconscious.

## The importance of being present
The first mistake rarely seals our fate.

It’s the continuous series of mistakes, like an avalanche, that can bury us deeper in our own problems and overwhelm us.

When we are not present and completely focused in the moment, we risk missing vital clues and information in our environment. As a result, we are prone to make more mistakes and squander valuable time in our day. We rob ourselves of the richness in our lives. We may even end up blocking our own path to achieving our full potential.

So, what exactly does it mean to be present? Presence, as I will be discussing it here, is the ability to focus on what you’re doing _right now._

When we’re not present, we have a kind of out-of-body experience as our mind wanders to this and that. For instance, have you ever driven home after a fun night with friends, only to find yourself replaying the evening’s events in your head? You recreate the entire night and re-analyze everything. You create your own personal mental movie.

Pretty soon, you start to wonder w_hy did she say that?_ or _I hope they didn’t take what I said the wrong way._ Before you know it, 20 minutes have passed, and you’re home without knowing how you got home. By the time you walk in the door, you’re no longer sure that dinner went as well as you thought.

Swap out the dinner scenario for an interview or a date, and you’ll see how prevalent this is. But you’re not alone if you’ve experienced this mental wandering. It happens to all of us.

Even to Navy SEALs.

## The Navy SEAL Mindset
Teddy Mitrosilis, a writer, shared his lessons from a 3-day wilderness training with a Navy SEAL, discussing their mindset.

On Twitter, Teddy mentioned that the SEALs focus on three pillars of mindset:

-   Patient
-   Present
-   Deliberate

Navy SEALs have a reputation for toughness. They undergo one of the most demanding training programs worldwide, with nearly 70% of them failing, according to NPR. Rigorous tasks, like spending five days with little sleep and continuous exertion, play a crucial role in their training.

Despite the difficult nature of SEAL training, SEALs often say the same thing. There’s no single element in itself that’s extraordinarily difficult. It’s the totality of the experience that wears you down.

Given this, when do you think most people will likely quit SEAL training?

A reasonable guess would be Hell Week. But surprisingly, that’s wrong. According to Teddy, Most people quit in one of the easiest evolutions. A 1-mile beach run with no time requirement. The only requirement is that you have to look like you’re running.

One catch: you don’t know when it will end. You run until the instructors tell you to stop.

So why do so many recruits quit when they only need to do a light jog?

I’m sure you’ve guessed it by now. They failed to stay present.

They don’t know when the run will end, so the doubt starts creeping in. Instead of staying focused on the present and the next step, their minds get swamped by thoughts of being unable to keep going. They quit.

And herein lies the heart of the problem.

Presence eludes us because of our judgments, and our judgment of a situation leads to detachment from reality.

## Judgment detaches us from reality
What are judgments, anyway? In “The Inner Game of Tennis,” author Timothy Gallwey defines them as:

> “Judgments are our personal, ego reactions to sights, sounds, feelings, and thoughts within our experience.”

In other words, it’s a layer of detachment from reality. Not reality itself.

There’s the event and our personal interpretation layered on top of it. When we’re unaware of this, as so often happens throughout the day, it’s as if we’re looking at the world through smudged glasses and forgetting we have them on. And based on your mental state — happy, sad, tired, or energetic — your interpretation (the smudginess of the glasses) could vary.

The Navy SEAL example shows that negative self-judgment can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you keep telling yourself that you’re bad at a task or can’t achieve something, your mind will believe it. These thoughts become expectations, and soon, you’ll start living up to those low expectations.

So, now that we understand the importance of being present and the obstacles we face, what techniques can we apply to stay more present during the day?

## How to inject presence into your day
First, let me acknowledge that for most (if not all) of us, achieving 100% presence throughout the day will be near impossible. The mind is a tricky beast to wrangle, and lapses in concentration will happen. This leads us to our first tip.

### 1. Give yourself grace
As the saying goes, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

It’s important to remember that expectations are tied to a future product or result. You’re no longer rooted in the present when you fail to give yourself grace and judge yourself for not accomplishing everything. Instead of setting a lofty goal, focus on the process. Be present for a single task, hour, or even a minute.

Then do it again.

### 2. Remember that positive and negative evaluation are two sides of the same coin
Feeling optimistic about changing our behaviors is easy when we have momentum. But this optimism, while it feels good now, can also lead to frustration later.

Here is Timothy Gallwey again reminding us of the problem with this type of thinking.

> When one has tried hard to perform an action “right,” it is difficult not to become either frustrated at failure or anxious about success. Both emotions are distracting to one’s focus, and prevent full experiencing of what happens. Negative judgment of the results of one’s efforts tends to make one try even harder; positive evaluation tends to make one try to force oneself into the same pattern on the next shot. Both positive and negative thinking inhibit spontaneity.

Acknowledge your feelings, but always return to focusing on your task.

### 3. Seek out the little things
Natural focus is the result of an interested mind.

When you feel bored, impatient, rushed, or disappointed, it means you’re not in the present moment. Losing focus often occurs when you judge an activity as less enjoyable, causing your mind to drift to the past or future. For instance, it’s usually easier to concentrate and achieve a flow state when playing video games or engaging in a pleasant activity.

When you encounter an activity that you think will be less than enjoyable, see if you can make a game out of it.

For the first 5–10 minutes, notice as much as possible. See how many new things you can notice that you’ve never noticed before. For example, if you need to sweep the floors, you may pay attention to the following:

-   Sensory details like scent or sound.
-   Patterns that may arise in the environment.
-   How the room changes over time.
-   How your own breathing changes.
-   The stories of the objects in the room.

Small details often become significant. The careful observation of these details is a key aspect of many artists’ ability to connect with others in a profound way.

## Don’t let your attention slide
> “When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will get back a grip on it whenever you wish — instead, bear in mind that because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be necessarily worse. . . . Is it possible to be free from error? Not by any means, but it is possible to be a person always stretching to avoid error. For we must be content to at least escape a few mistakes by never letting our attention slide.” — EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.12.1; 19

Josh eventually moved on to P.S. 116 after the police and ambulance showed up to help the injured woman. But the lesson from that day stuck. We must always try our best to stay present and not let our attention slide. Because when we do, even the smallest of errors can compound, and once that happens, everything that follows will be worse.
