[[Charlie Munger]] advocates using what he calls a "a broad latticework of mental models" (see:  [[What are mental models?]]) to help better think through problems and understand the world. These simplified chunks of knowledge we've obtained from various disciplines can help identify what information is relevant in any given situation and establish reasonable parameters for problem solving. 

Multidisciplinary thinking in this way helps: 
- Make us less vulnerable to compounding mistakes.
- Reduce stress.
- Increases freedom.
- Allow for more diverse solutions. 

In essence, we can [[Enhance decision-making by reducing blindspots with mental models]] and get closer to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]. But first we have to [[Overcome obstacles to learning from reality]].

> Munger has a way of thinking through problems using what he calls a broad latticework of mental models. These are chunks of knowledge from different disciplines that can be simplified and applied to better understand the world. The way he describes it, they help identify what information is relevant in any given situation, and the most reasonable parameters to work in.

> Not having the ability to shift perspective by applying knowledge from multiple disciplines makes us vulnerable. Mistakes can become catastrophes whose effects keep compounding, creating stress and limiting our choices. Multidisciplinary thinking, learning these mental models and applying them across our lives, creates less stress and more freedom. The more we can draw on the diverse knowledge contained in these models, the more solutions will present themselves.
