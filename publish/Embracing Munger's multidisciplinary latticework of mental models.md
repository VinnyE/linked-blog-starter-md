The quality of our thinking and decision-making is greatly influenced by the variety and accuracy of the mental models we employ. Limiting ourselves to specific disciplines can result in a narrow perspective, leading to blind spots and the overuse of familiar models, even when they're not applicable (see: [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]]). By adopting [[Charlie Munger]]'s approach to building a "broad latticework of mental models" (see: [[What are mental models]]), we can foster multidisciplinary thinking that enables us to identify relevant information and establish practical parameters for problem-solving.

Multidisciplinary thinking, as promoted by Munger, offers numerous benefits, such as making us less vulnerable to compounding mistakes, reducing stress, increasing freedom, and allowing for more diverse solutions. This approach not only helps improve our understanding of complex systems but also leads to more informed decisions.

To truly leverage mental models, we must first [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]] and learn to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]. By integrating various mental models and experiences into a latticework of knowledge, we can better understand the world around us and the connections between different fields.

> Munger has a way of thinking through problems using what he calls a broad latticework of mental models. These are chunks of knowledge from different disciplines that can be simplified and applied to better understand the world. The way he describes it, they help identify what information is relevant in any given situation, and the most reasonable parameters to work in. 

> Not having the ability to shift perspective by applying knowledge from multiple disciplines makes us vulnerable. Mistakes can become catastrophes whose effects keep compounding, creating stress and limiting our choices. Multidisciplinary thinking, learning these mental models and applying them across our lives, creates less stress and more freedom. The more we can draw on the diverse knowledge contained in these models, the more solutions will present themselves.

> The quality of our thinking is largely influenced by the mental models in our heads. While we want accurate models, we also want a wide variety of models to uncover what’s really happening. The key here is variety. Most of us study something specific and don’t get exposure to the big ideas of other disciplines. We don’t develop the multidisciplinary mindset that we need to accurately see a problem. And because we don’t have the right models to understand the situation, we overuse the models we do have and use them even when they don’t belong

> In short, they have blind spots. Big blind spots. And they’re not aware of their blind spots. There is an old adage that encapsulates this: “To the man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail.” Not every problem is a nail. The world is full of complications and interconnections that can only be explained through understanding of multiple models.

> Here’s another way to look at it: think of a forest. When a botanist looks at it they may focus on the ecosystem, an environmentalist sees the impact of climate change, a forestry engineer the state of the tree growth, a business person the value of the land. None are wrong, but neither are any of them able to describe the full scope of the forest. Sharing knowledge, or learning the basics of the other disciplines, would lead to a more well-rounded understanding that would allow for better initial decisions about managing the forest. 

>  In a famous speech in the 1990s, Charlie Munger summed up this approach to practical wisdom: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‘em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.” 

> The world does not isolate itself into discrete disciplines. We only break it down that way because it makes it easier to study it. But once we learn something, we need to put it back into the complex system in which it occurs. We need to see where it connects to other bits of knowledge, to build our understanding of the whole. This is the value of putting the knowledge contained in mental models into a latticework.

But parochialism is everywhere, and the world badly needs international and interdisciplinary travelers to carry new knowledge from one enclave to another. In S.
