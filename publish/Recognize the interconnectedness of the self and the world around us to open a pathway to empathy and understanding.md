The interconnectedness between ourselves, others, and the world around us shapes our understanding of love, learning, and creative expression. When we realize how connected we are, we feel thankful for what others have done and want to share our own unique talents with the world. In doing so, we cultivate empathy, compassion, and understanding, enriching our own lives and the lives of those around us, while fostering a cycle of growth and learning that benefits all.

One way we can start noticing the connections between domains and ideas is by [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]].

>  "What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that's been done by others before us. I didn't invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It's about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how-because we can't write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That's what has driven me."
