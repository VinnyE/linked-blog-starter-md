Sometimes, we must dismantle our strategies and techniques to enable growth and reinvention. This process can feel vulnerable, like a hermit crab in between shells (see: [[Just like the hermit crab must leave its shell and face vulnerability in order to find a larger, more fitting shell, individuals must embrace a long-term, organic learning process instead of sticking to static, safe mediocrity]]), but it's essential for development and improvement. Recognizing these periods as opportunities for growth, rather than setbacks, is key to long-term success.
