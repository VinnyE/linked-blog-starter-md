Before we react to a situation or an interaction, inserting a pause can allow for reflection and thoughtfulness. This pause can remind us that our natural responses are often mediated by our personal fears, desires, and needs. It can help us to step out of our habitual scripts and consider more thoughtful and considerate responses.
