title: "Organizations are shifting to problem-solving orientations, with AI playing a crucial role"
created: May 24, 2023

As we move away from the traditional emphasis on strategy development and execution, organizations are becoming more agile and are evolving into problem-solving entities. This shift requires honing complex problem-solving and critical thinking skills ([[Problem solving is a vital skill in the 21st century]]), also referred to as mental muscle. Further, advances in machine learning are increasingly being used to enhance problem-solving efforts. This machine muscle frees human problem solvers from computational drudgery, amplifying pattern recognition capabilities and enabling faster organizational response to external challenges.

Interestingly, [[Sam Altman]] also expresses his belief in this view of increasingly leveraging AI to handle complex business tasks in [[A Conversation With OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  Hosted by Elevate]]:

>  I think humans will have a role Toby and I were talking earlier this analogy that like everybody's going to be the CEO of like all of the work they want to do and they'll have tons of people that they're able to coordinate and direct and sort of provide the taste and the feedback on um but they'll have like lots of agents for lack of a better word that go off and do increasingly complex tasks

### North: Theme / Question
- What does this mean for solopreneurship? As we rely more on machines/agents to do the work, the value of individuals that can break apart problems and delegate specific problems to agents well goes up. Smaller personal teams means less overhead, and likely increased agility. You can be more nimble with a team of 1 and an army of machines. Organizations with thousands of people are likely to be a little slower in being able to pivot a strategy, but may have other benefits. #build 
- What role does Quality as defined by Persig play into this? Taste & feedback seem important #build

### South: What does this lead to?

> As organizations seek to become clever and agile to address this new world, they take on the persona of problem solving organizations—a drive to be working on the right problems, addressing root causes, engaging teams around short duration work plans, and allocating responsibilities and timelines with accountability.

> The 70s and 80s were characterized by intense interest in strategy development. That was displaced by an era from the 90s onward that focused on execution, including deep attention to getting things done, as exemplified by the book Execution by Ram Charan and Larry Bossidy, and a number of books on business process redesign. However, a ruthless focus on execution assumes you have strategic direction right and can adapt to new competition, frequently from outside your industry. This can no longer be assumed. As this new era of the problem solving organization takes hold, we expect it will trigger even more interest in how teams go about sharpening complex problem solving and critical thinking skills—what is called mental muscle by the authors of The Mathematical Corporation.

> Problem solving will increasingly utilize advances in machine learning to predict patterns in consumer behavior, disease, credit risk, and other complex phenomena, termed machine muscle.

> To meet the challenges of the twenty‐first century, mental muscle and machine muscle have to work together. Machine learning frees human problem solvers from computational drudgery and amplifies the pattern recognition required for faster organizational response to external challenges. For this partnership to work, twenty‐first century organizations need staff who are quick on their feet, who learn new skills quickly, and who attack emerging problems with confidence.
