### The Paradox of Wild Problems
[[Wild problems are the significant, life-altering decisions we encounter, where the outcomes are unclear, and each choice can significantly influence our identity and future]]. They require an acceptance of ambiguity and the ability to thrive in uncertainty (in other words, an [[The Antifragile Mindset]]).

Bill favors quantity over perceived quality in his draft strategy, underscoring that certainty is an illusion in the face of complexity.
