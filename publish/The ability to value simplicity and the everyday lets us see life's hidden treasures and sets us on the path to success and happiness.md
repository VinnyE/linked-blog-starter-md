### Embracing the Ordinary and the Wait
Life is not a series of climax moments, but a mixture of ordinary and exceptional times. A key to excelling during high-pressure situations is to not only be good at waiting but to love it, as it is life itself. We should find joy and richness in mundane moments and consider these as integral parts of our lives. The ability to value simplicity and the everyday lets us see life's hidden treasures and sets us on the path to success and happiness.
