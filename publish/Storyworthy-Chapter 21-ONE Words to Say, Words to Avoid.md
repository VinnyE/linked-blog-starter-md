Communication and storytelling require careful selection of words and techniques. Avoid unnecessary profanity, replacing it with more effective and descriptive language, unless it's to convey authenticity, emphasize extreme emotions, or enhance humor. Vulgarity should be implied through euphemisms and allusions rather than explicit descriptions, especially in uncomfortable topics. It's acceptable to change people's names in your stories to maintain their anonymity, yet villains should be identified. Avoid celebrity or pop culture references and imitating accents, as these may alienate parts of your audience and impose undesired imagery. Always respect the potential consequences for others in the narratives you share, and consider their effects on relationships and reputations.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Use of Profanity
Profanity in communication can potentially harm your credibility and reduce your appeal to certain audiences. Resorting to swear words can come across as lazy and lack creativity. However, exceptions exist when profanity might be the best choice: to represent a dialogue verbatim, describe a person or situation perfectly, capture extreme emotions, or add a humorous touch.

### Approach to Vulgarity
Vulgarity, or describing profane actions, often requires a delicate touch. Using strategies such as euphemisms, allusion, self-deprecation, and humor can communicate the essence of a situation without exposing uncomfortable details. Consider the potential discomfort of discussing certain topics openly with family members as a gauge for how to handle them in your storytelling.

### The Treatment of People's Names
While it's permissible to change names in stories to preserve privacy, it's advisable to choose similar names to make recall easier. Be aware of the potential harm in sharing certain stories which could damage relationships or expose others' secrets. Yet, owning your stories is essential, and naming the villains of your narratives can be important.

### The Pitfalls of Celebrity References
Referencing celebrities or pop culture icons in narratives can alienate audience members who aren't familiar with them, impose unintended imagery, and even disrupt the realistic feel of the story. It's a form of shorthand that doesn't provide a deep understanding of a character, and can be seen as a lazy storytelling technique.

### The Use of Accents
Accents can introduce stereotyping and risk alienating your audience. The exception would be mimicking accents of parents and grandparents, or those from your own upbringing, where a shared cultural context can be assumed. These are areas where potential misunderstandings or offense are less likely.

### References

> The words you will choose will in part determine how your audience perceives you. It will impact the opinions that they form about you. Here is my advice on these matters

##### Profanity
> A storyteller who leans heavily on profanity isn’t likely to be hired to teach children, rabbis, corporate executives, librarians, priests, or teachers. He’s less likely to be hired to perform for nonprofits, yoga institutes, holiday parties, religious retreats, high schools, and more. Also, swearing is lazy. In most cases, a swear word can be replaced by a better word or phrase. The swear word is easy and may engender a laugh, but it's rarely the best word to choose. 
> 
> That said, there are times when I think it is appropriate to swear:
>  • Repeated dialogue: The kid who arrives at my car accident swears. He says, “Dude, you’re fucked.” It’s his words, repeated exactly.
>  • When a swear is simply the best word possible: There is no better way to describe my former stepfather than asshole, so that is the word I choose every time.
>  • Moments of extreme emotion: There are certainly times in our lives when the best way to capture the heightened emotion of a moment — particularly when it comes to anger and fear — is with profanity.
>  • Humor: Though I would never rely solely on profanity for humor, there are moments when a well-placed swear word makes a perfect punch line to a joke.

##### Vulgarity
> Vulgarity is the description of events that are profane in nature. This includes actions of sexual nature, anything involving bodily fluids, and the like. 
> 
> use euphemisms, allusion, self-deprecation, and humor to set the scene without exposing the scene. Everyone knows the reality of the situation without needing to know the exact reality of the situation.
> 
> The rule with vulgarity is simple: If you are speaking about a topic that would be awkward to talk about with your parents or grandparents, tread lightly. Take care of your audience.

##### Other People’s Names
> I tell storytellers that changing the names of people to protect their anonymity is perfectly reasonable. When you change the name, however, I always suggest that you choose a similar name to make it easier to remember. 
> 
> Sometimes we just don’t tell certain stories. Speaking them aloud might irreparably damage relationships with loved ones. You may expose someone else’s secret. You may put your job or your company in jeopardy. Sometimes it’s just not worth the story.
> 
> I'm a big believer in the words of novelist Anne Lamott: “You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.” For this reason, I also name my former stepfather by both his first and last name in my stories. I believe in naming the villains in our lives.

##### Celebrity / Pop Culture References
>  When we refer to celebrities in our stories, we make three mistakes:
>  1. We risk alienating half of our audience, who might not be aware of the reference. While one side of the room nods and laughs in recognition, the other side of the room feels foolish or lost.
>  2. Comparing a person to a celebrity sticks that celebrity into the story and pops that mystical time-traveling bubble. I once heard a storyteller say that her father looked a lot like Ronald Reagan. As a result, Reagan was now playing the role of her father in the story, and having a former president walking around her cruddy little apartment made no sense. It’s impossible for an audience to picture someone looking “kind of like Ronald Reagan.” They will just use Reagan, turning a formerly sensible story into something dreamlike and strange. Just don’t do it.
>  3. It’s lazy. We gain very little by saying “so-and-so looks or acts like so-and-so.” It’s shorthand, but it doesn’t reveal much about character.

##### Accents
> The rule on accents is simple: Don't. There is one exception to this rule: you can always do the accents of parents and grandparents. Parental love conquers the potential hazards of racial stereotypes. I also think that you can imitate the accents from the region where you grew up, particularly if you share a race with the people who you are imitating.
