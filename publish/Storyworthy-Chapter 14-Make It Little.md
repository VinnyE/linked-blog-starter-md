Big, dramatic stories, like surviving a near-death experience, may seem thrilling, but they often miss the mark in truly connecting with an audience. The key to good storytelling isn't about grandeur, but authenticity and relatability. It's about finding those small, human moments within the larger spectacle, the ones that touch our shared experiences and emotions. So, while the plot may involve dinosaurs or deadly accidents, the story we should really be telling is about learning to love or facing our fears—those are the stories that resonate and bridge the gap between us.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Challenge of Big Stories
High-stakes, dramatic tales might seem exciting, but their uniqueness can make them difficult to connect with. The experiences they describe are often so extraordinary that they become hard for most people to relate to. Despite their appeal, these big stories can sometimes create distance rather than connection between the storyteller and the audience.

### The Goal of Storytelling
The true aim of storytelling isn't about taking the audience on a roller-coaster ride of excitement, but rather about creating a genuine connection between the storyteller and the listener. This connection is built through authenticity, vulnerability, and the sharing of universal truths.

### The Power of Small Moments
To make big stories relatable, storytellers need to uncover the small, comprehensible moments within them—those instances that touch on common human experiences and emotions. It's these little moments, hidden within the grand narratives, that audiences can truly connect with and understand.

> “This Is Going to Suck” is what I call a big story. When you are brought back to life in the back of an ambulance, that’s big. Here’s the surprising thing: despite what most people think, these are the hardest stories to tell. You’d think that a head-on collision, dying, and coming back to life would be easy to tell about, full of high stakes, drama, and excitement, but remember: The goal of storytelling is to connect with your audience, whether it’s one person at the dinner table or two thousand people in a theater. Storytelling is not about a roller-coaster ride of excitement. It’s about bridging the gap between you and another person by creating a space of authenticity, vulnerability, and universal truth. If this is the goal (and it should be), then the big stories can get in the way of connecting. I cannot connect with most people on the level of a near-death experience. Audiences don’t listen to me describe my head crashing through a windshield and think, “Yes, I remember the time my head went through a windshield, and yes, I also subsequently died on the side of the road. I feel for you, Matt.” Big stories are hard stories to tell, because the big parts of these stories are often singular in nature. Unusual. Unique. Hardly relatable.

> This is the trick to telling a big story: it cannot be about anything big. Instead we must find the small, relatable, comprehensible moments in our larger stories. We must find the piece of the story that people can connect to, relate to, and understand. You need to find the story of the man who learns to love children among the man-eating dinosaurs so he can be with the woman he loves. Little moments hidden inside big moments. That’s what we need to find to tell a big story well.
