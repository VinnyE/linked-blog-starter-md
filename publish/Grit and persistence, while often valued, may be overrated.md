Grit and persistence, while often valued, may be overrated. Russ Roberts suggests reevaluating whether to persist when faced with unpleasantries or difficulties. If a path chosen turns out to be unfulfilling, change should not be seen as a failure but as a proactive step towards better alignment with our evolving selves. This notion liberates us from the fear of regret and allows us to embrace change, enriching our life's journey.
