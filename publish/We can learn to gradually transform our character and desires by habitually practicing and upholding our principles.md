title: "We can learn to gradually transform our character and desires by habitually practicing and upholding our principles"

The choices we make do more than just determining the immediate outcomes of our actions; they also shape who we are and who we aspire to become. Our decisions can influence our identity and character, especially when these decisions involve upholding our principles over prioritizing immediate gains. Habitual practice of upholding our principles can gradually transform our desires and character. By pretending to be good and consistently behaving accordingly, we can progressively actualize our ideal self. This transformation process does not necessarily mean being perfect, but continuously striving for improvement.

This is the lesson from the short story [The Happy Hypocrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happy_Hypocrite) by Max Beerbohm.
