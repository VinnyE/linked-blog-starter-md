While the ego can sometimes be an obstacle (see: [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]), it also drives us to achieve great things. Being self-aware helps us determine when the ego is helpful and when it holds us back. By focusing on outcomes rather than our own self-image, we can maintain a healthy balance between ego and self-awareness.

> Ego, of course, is more than the enemy. It’s also our friend. If we had a perfect view of the world and made decisions rationally, we would never attempt to do the amazing things that make us human. Ego propels us. Why, without ego, would we even attempt to travel to Mars? After all, it’s never been done before. We’d never start a business because most of them fail. We need to learn to understand when ego serves us and when it hinders us. Wrapping ego up in outcomes instead of in ourselves makes it easier to update our views.
