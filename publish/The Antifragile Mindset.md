In an inherently unpredictable and volatile world (especially now with AI), the best way to thrive is to develop an antifragile mindset. This involves embracing and benefiting from volatility and unpredictability, rather than attempting to predict or control them. The key to success in such an environment is to prepare for the unexpected rather than futilely attempting to predict it. 

One effective way to foster antifragility is by maximizing [[Upside optionality]], or actively seeking out situations with potential opportunities. Engaging in such scenarios increases the chances of serendipity and favorable outcomes, even if they are not guaranteed. 

Another important aspect of the antifragile mindset is [[Learning how to fail properly]].

> Here is the core of the idea. We can think about three categories of objects: Ones that are harmed by volatility and unpredictability, ones that are neutral to volatility and unpredictability, and finally, ones that benefit from it. The latter category is antifragile—like a package that wants to be mishandled. Up to a point, certain things benefit from volatility, and that’s how we want to be. Why? Because the world is fundamentally unpredictable and volatile, and large events—panics, crashes, wars, bubbles, and so on—tend to have a disproportionate impact on outcomes. 

> There are two ways to handle such a world: try to predict, or try to prepare. ... The problem is that nearly all studies of “expert” predictions in such complex real-world realms as the stock market, geopolitics, and global finance have proven again and again that, for the rare and impactful events in our world, predicting is impossible! It’s more efficient to prepare

> The Antifragile mindset is a unique one. Whenever possible, try to create scenarios where randomness and uncertainty are your friends, not your enemies.
