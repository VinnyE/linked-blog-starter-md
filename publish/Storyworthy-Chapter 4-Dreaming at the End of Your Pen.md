"Crash & Burn" is a stream-of-consciousness writing approach that mirrors the free-associative thought patterns we experience during dreams. The method encourages unrestricted flow of ideas, demanding non-attachment to any single thought and complete non-judgment. Writing must continue regardless of the presence or absence of any thought, where even listing colors or numbers could ignite a new idea. By following these rules, writers can tap into their subconscious and resurrect old memories, thereby generating fresh and unexpected ideas and narratives. This method is both a powerful creative tool and a soul-enriching exercise.

## Concept Breakdown

### Crash & Burn Writing Technique
"Crash & Burn" is a creative writing strategy that facilitates the free flow of ideas from one's subconscious. It's likened to dreaming while awake, where one's mind can freely wander, generating a plethora of unique and unexpected narratives and concepts. This approach encourages writers to explore their thoughts deeply, helping them develop a rich assortment of ideas and revitalize dormant memories.

### Rule 1: Non-Attachment to Ideas
In "Crash & Burn", writers should not cling to any single idea. The strategy's essence lies in allowing new ideas to intersect and overrun existing ones. This constant flux and clash of thoughts is where unexpected and exciting narratives and concepts emerge. The writer should not hesitate to let go of an intriguing thought when a new one emerges, even if it seems less compelling.

### Rule 2: Non-Judgment of Thoughts
Another integral principle of the "Crash & Burn" method is the complete absence of judgment. Regardless of the nature of the thought—ridiculous, absurd, or even embarrassing—it must find its way onto the page. Similarly, grammar, punctuation, and writing style are irrelevant during this process. This unconditional acceptance of thoughts enables the writer to express freely without the constraint of judgment or worry about quality.

### Rule 3: Continuous Writing
The third rule of "Crash & Burn" mandates continuous writing. The physical act of writing—or typing, if necessary—must persist even when the mind seems empty. Techniques such as listing colors or numbers in word form can help trigger new thoughts or memories, ensuring that the writing does not cease. This constant motion facilitates a deeper plunge into the subconscious, helping unearth unique and forgotten ideas and narratives.

### Soul Enrichment through Creative Writing
Aside from being a potent tool for idea generation, "Crash & Burn" is also considered a soul-enriching exercise. By allowing a free flow of thoughts without judgment or attachment, writers can explore their innermost feelings, thoughts, and memories. This deep self-reflection can provide a sense of catharsis and personal understanding, enriching the soul and contributing to overall well-being.

> Even with a journal at my bedside, it’s almost impossible to remember any of these dreams, and rarely do I generate any useful ideas or content from them. But I have developed a way of engaging in a version of this dreamlike state while I am awake that has been incredibly productive and has resulted in many ideas for stories, anecdotes for stories, and much more. It’s also damn good for your soul.

> Essentially Crash & Burn is stream-of-consciousness writing. I like to think of it as dreaming on the end of your pen, because when it’s working well, it will mimic the free-associative thought patterns that so many of us experience while dreaming.

> Stream of consciousness is the act of speaking or writing down whatever thought that enters your mind, regardless of how strange, incongruous, or even embarrassing it may be. People have been utilizing stream-of-consciousness strategies for a long time, beginning first with psychologists in the late nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, these strategies were adopted by writers and thinkers as a means of generating new ideas. But for our storytelling purposes, we will be utilizing stream-of-consciousness writing to generate new ideas and resurrect old memories, applying three important rules: 

> Rule #1: You must not get attached to any one idea. 
> The goal of Crash & Burn is to allow unexpected ideas to intersect and overrun current ones, just as that rain-drenched corner of Main Street with my dog produced an important revelation about my father and a memory of sex on a golf course. Two intersecting ideas crashed into and overran the meaningful moment that I was experiencing with Kaleigh. 
> So, regardless of how intriguing or compelling your current idea may be, you must release it immediately when a new idea comes crashing in, even if your new idea seems decidedly less compelling than the original one. When Crash & Burn is at its best, ideas are constantly crashing the party, slashing and burning the previous ones. It’s in these intersections of ideas that new ideas and memories are unearthed. 

> Rule #2: You must not judge any thought or idea that appears in your mind. 
> Everything must land on the page, regardless of how ridiculous, nonsensical, absurd, or humiliating it may be. Similarly, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization are meaningless. Penmanship is irrelevant. You must spill your guts on the page, free from judgment or worry about whether what you are writing is good or right.

> Rule #3: You cannot allow the pen to stop moving.
> I say pen because, although I do almost all my writing on a keyboard, I have found that engaging in Crash & Burn with a pen tends to trigger greater creativity (and there is some science to support this claim). But if you must use a keyboard, go for it. 
> Either way, your hand or fingers cannot stop moving. You must continue writing words even when your mind is empty. To make this happen, I use colors. When I have no other thought in my mind, I begin listing colors on the page until one of them triggers a thought or memory.  Writing down numbers is also a popular strategy utilized by my workshop students, though I recommend that the numbers be list in word form. 
> 
> That's it. Set a timer for ten minutes, follow these three rules, and go.
