**Stress and Recovery as a Foundation for High-Level Performance**
The practice of "Stress and Recovery" serves as a critical foundation for high-level performance. This principle advocates for balancing periods of intense work with moments of rest and relaxation, allowing the mind and body to recover and rejuvenate. As this rhythm is internalized, the time it takes to recover from exertion decreases, while access to the unconscious mind increases. This bolsters creativity, intuition, and authenticity. This ultimately enhancing overall performance, even in stressful situations, enabling consistent and reliable performance.
