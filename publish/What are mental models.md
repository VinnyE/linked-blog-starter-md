Mental models are representations of how something works. They're important because: 

- They help to simplify complex information into understandable and organizable chunks. 
- They shape our how we think, how we understand, and how we form beliefs, operating largely subconsciously. 
- They are how we infer causality, match patterns, and draw analogies. 

If we want to learn how to [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]] and start to [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]], a good place to start would be [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]].

> Mental models describe the way the world works. They shape how we think, how we understand, and how we form beliefs. Largely subconscious, mental models operate below the surface. We’re not generally aware of them and yet they’re the reason when we look at a problem we consider some factors relevant and others irrelevant. They are how we infer causality, match patterns, and draw analogies. They are how we think and reason.
