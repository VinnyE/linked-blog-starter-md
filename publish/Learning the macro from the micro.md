Learning should be like diving into a deep ocean, not skimming the surface of a shallow pond. It's not about knowing a little about a lot but delving into the details of a few and understanding them inside out. In today's fast-paced world, distractions are everywhere, making us surface skimmers, addicted to constant stimuli. But real learning, the kind that leads to accomplishment, happens when we turn away from the noise and delve into the quiet depths of knowledge. It's about understanding the small things to make sense of the bigger picture. Only by exploring the micro can we truly understand what makes the macro tick.

## Concept Breakdown

[[Learning is best approached as a deep dive into specific subjects rather than a broad, shallow skim across many]]

[[A successful learning journey requires a high degree of focus in order to be able to perceive what's hidden in plain sight]]

[[Resist society's distractions in order to pursue depth in learning]]

[[True learning involves embracing the beauty that comes from completely immersing ourselves in a subject]]

[[Studying the minute, micro aspects of a subject can lead to a better understanding of its macro components]]

> My search for the essential principles lying at the hearts of and connecting chess, the martial arts, and in a broader sense the learning process, was inspired to a certain extent by Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I'll never forget a scene that would guide my approach to learning for years to come. The protagonist of Pirsig's story, a brilliant if eccentric man named Phaedrus, is teaching a rhetorical student who is all jammed up when given the assignment to write a five-hundred-word story about her town. She can't write a word. The town seems so small, so incidental–what could possible be interesting enough to write about? Phaedrus liberates the girl from her writer's block by changing the assignment. He asks her to write about the front of the opera house outside her classroom on a small street in a small neighborhood of that same dull town. She should begin with the upper-left hand brick. At first the student is incredulous, but then a torrent of creativity unleashes and she can't stop writing. The next day she comes to class with twenty inspired pages.

> I believe this little anecdote has the potential to distinguish success from failure in the pursuit of excellence. The theme is depth over breadth. The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the micro in order to understand what makes the macro tick. Our obstacle is that we live in an attention-deficit culture. We are bombarded with more and more information on television, radio, cell phones, video games, the Internet. The constant supply of stimulus has the potential to turn us into addicts, always hungering for something new and prefabricated to keep us entertained. When nothing exciting is going on, we might get bored, distracted, separated from the moment. So we look for new entertainment, surf channels, flip through magazines. If caught in these rhythms, we are like tiny current-bound surface fish, floating along a two-dimensional world without any sense for the gorgeous abyss below. When these societally induced tendencies translate into the learning process, they have devastating effect.

> We cannot hope to grasp the inherent joy and beauty of learning nor lead a life of serious accomplishment if we only skim the surfaces of subjects and acquaint ourselves with thin layers of knowledge. In order to excel, our approach to learning must emphasize depth over breadth. We have to resist the attraction to superficial stimulation that our media-driven society cultivates. The alternative is to dive deeply into small pools of information in order to explore and experience the operating principles of whatever we are learning. Once we grasp the essence of our subject through focused study of core principles, we can build on nuanced insights and, eventually, see a much bigger picture. The essence of this approach is to study the micro in order to learn what makes the macro tick. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/advanced-learning/learning-the-macro-from-the-micro/
