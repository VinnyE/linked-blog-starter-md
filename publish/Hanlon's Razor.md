Hanlon's Razor is a mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) that guides us to attribute the cause of an incident to incompetence or misunderstanding rather than malicious intent. This principle encourages us to evaluate situations more objectively, avoiding the trap of paranoia and ideologically driven assumptions. In a complex world, it's crucial to consider the possibility of errors or misunderstandings rather than immediately jumping to the conclusion of malevolence. This perspective allows us to explore other plausible explanations and, in doing so, opens the door to solutions and opportunities we might otherwise overlook.

[[The Fallacy of Conjunction]] as demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky, is an example of how our perceptions can be skewed by vivid, readily available information

In contrast, Hanlon's Razor serves as a corrective lens, prompting us to prioritize misunderstanding or ignorance over malice. It reminds us that not everyone who does something wrong is malicious – many are simply unaware or making a mistake. By consistently assuming malice, we place ourselves at the center of everyone else's world, leading to a distorted, self-centered perspective (see: [[Self-awareness is the ego's antidote]]). In reality, acts of malice are vastly outnumbered by those of ignorance, error, and apathy.

Applying Hanlon's Razor diligently helps counteract confirmation bias, fostering a more realistic and effective approach to dealing with challenging situations. When we perceive others as hostile, we naturally adopt a defensive stance, focusing on self-preservation at the expense of broader perspectives and opportunities. By reframing our interpretation of events through the lens of Hanlon's Razor, we can shift from a defensive mode to a more proactive and empowered one, better equipped to navigate complexities and seize potential opportunities.

> Hanlon’s Razor states that we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. In a complex world, using this model helps us avoid paranoia and ideology. By not generally assuming that bad results are the fault of a bad actor, we look for options instead of missing opportunities. This model reminds us that people do make mistakes. It demands that we ask if there is another reasonable explanation for the events that have occurred. The explanation most likely to be right is the one that contains the least amount of intent. 

> When we see something we don’t like happen and which seems wrong, we assume it’s intentional. But it’s more likely that it’s completely unintentional. Assuming someone is doing wrong and doing it purposefully is like assuming Linda is more likely to be a bank teller and a feminist. Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious.

> With such vividness, and the associated emotional response, comes a sort of malfunctioning in our minds when we’re trying to diagnose the causes of a bad situation. That’s why we need Hanlon’s Razor as an important remedy. Failing to prioritize stupidity over malice causes things like paranoia. Always assuming malice puts you at the center of everyone else’s world. This is an incredibly self-centered approach to life. In reality, for every act of malice, there is almost certainly far more ignorance, stupidity, and laziness.

> Hanlon’s Razor, when practiced diligently as a counter to confirmation bias, empowers us, and gives us far more realistic and effective options for remedying bad situations. When we assume someone is out to get us, our very natural instinct is to take actions to defend ourselves. It’s harder to take advantage of, or even see, opportunities while in this defensive mode because our priority is saving ourselves—which tends to reduce our vision to dealing with the perceived threat instead of examining the bigger picture
