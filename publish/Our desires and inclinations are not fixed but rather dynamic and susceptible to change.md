### The Dynamic Nature of Desires and the 'Feeding the Good Dog' Principle

> A Native American Elder once described his own inner struggles in this manner: “Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The other dog is good. The mean dog fights the good dog all the time.” When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied, “The one I feed the most.”

Our desires and inclinations are not fixed but rather dynamic and susceptible to change. The 'feeding the good dog' principle illustrates this concept—by continually choosing actions that align with our principles, we can nourish our virtuous character traits. Regularly feeding the good dog—our virtuous self—can lead to the cultivation of self-enforcing virtuous habits and behaviors.
