The Linda Problem is a well-known illustration of a cognitive bias called [[The Fallacy of Conjunction]], which was demonstrated by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. The problem is presented as follows:

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Which is more probable?

1.  Linda is a bank teller.
2.  Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

Contrary to the principles of probability (see: [[Probabalistic thinking]]), a majority of people choose the second option. According to probability rules, the likelihood of two events occurring together (in "conjunction") is always less than or equal to the likelihood of either one occurring alone (see: [[Correlation vs Causation]]).

However, because the second statement fits more closely with the vivid description given of Linda, people tend to believe that it's more likely, despite it being statistically less probable. This illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people overestimate the probability of co-occurring events due to the influence of descriptive, vivid, or stereotype-aligned information.

> Thus, Kahneman and Tversky showed that students would, with enough vivid wording, assume it more likely that a liberal-leaning woman was both a feminist and a bank teller rather than simply a bank teller. They called it the “Fallacy of Conjunction.” With this experiment, and a host of others, Kahneman and Tversky exposed a sort of tic in our mental machinery: we’re deeply affected by vivid, available evidence, to such a degree that we’re willing to make judgments that violate simple logic. We over-conclude based on the available information. We have no trouble packaging in unrelated factors if they happen to occur in proximity to what we already believe.
