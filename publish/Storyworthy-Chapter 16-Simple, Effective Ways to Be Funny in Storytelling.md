In storytelling, humor serves not as the main course but as a strategic tool that enriches the audience's emotional journey. You don't have to be inherently funny to craft a story with humorous elements. Contrary to stand-up comedy which aims for non-stop laughter, storytelling uses humor to create contrast, relieve tension, and amplify emotional depth. A well-placed laugh can break the ice, provide a breath of fresh air amid tension, or separate distinct emotional beats. Yet, the end of a story must land on a note of emotional resonance, not a punchline. Techniques such as setting up a laugh by stacking details (Milk Cans and a Baseball) and combining unusual elements (Babies and Blenders) can create humor while maintaining the story's integrity.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Role of Humor in Storytelling
Humor in storytelling serves a strategic purpose, enhancing the emotional journey rather than becoming the central focus. Even if you're not inherently funny, you can still incorporate humorous elements into your storytelling.

### Strategic Uses of Humor
Humor can be used strategically in various ways: to set the audience at ease, create a contrast to intensify an upcoming shock, relieve tension after a dramatic moment, and separate distinct emotional beats. These strategic uses of humor contribute to the overall emotional depth and engagement of the story.

### Ending a Story on Heart
While humor is a valuable tool in storytelling, the end of a story should land on an emotional note, creating a lasting connection with the audience. This resonant ending allows the story to linger in the audience's memory, making a deeper impact than a simple laugh.

### Techniques for Creating Humor
Creating humor in storytelling can be achieved through techniques such as setting up a laugh by stacking details (Milk Cans and a Baseball) and combining unusual elements (Babies and Blenders). These techniques allow the storyteller to introduce humor without compromising the story's authenticity and emotional resonance.

> I can't make you a funny person. I'm not sure if anyone can. But here's some good news:
> - Stories need not be funny. 
> - Even if you're not a funny person, you can still craft a story that contains funny moments.
> - Some of your stories will likely be funny even if you're not funny at all.
> - Stories should never only be funny. The best ones are those that user humor strategically. Ideally you want your audience to experience a range of emotions over the course of your story. You can't achieve this if your audience is laughing for the entire time.

> This is the difference between between storytelling and stand-up comedy. Imagine: You attend a fantastic night of stand-up comedy. The next day your coworker says, "Tell me some of the jokes you heard." Oftentimes you can't. Maybe you remember bits and pieces of a few, but unless you saw a comic like Louis C.K, who bases his comedy in storytelling, you can't reproduce many jokes, and probably none at all. The comic makes you feel good. You laugh all night. But the content doesn't stick. A week later, you probably won't remember a single thing from the show. A story, however, can stay with you for the rest of your life.

> Stand-ups want the audience to laugh at all times. Storytellers want the audience to laugh at the right times. Humor is an enormous asset in most stories, but it is not required and should be used strategically whenever possible.

> The story of my near-fatal car accident is not funny. No one would ever characterize it as funny, and yet I use humor four times in the story, in four very strategic ways, for four very different reasons:

##### 1. Start with a laugh
> I try to make the audience laugh here, because it’s always good to get your audience to laugh in the first thirty seconds of a story. A laugh at the beginning does these three things:
> 1. It signals to the audience: “I’m a good storyteller. I know what I’m doing. You can relax.”
> 2. In a small, less formal situation, this early laugh will serve as a stop sign for potential interruptions. It serves as an unspoken signal that you have the floor. In fact, whenever faced with a person who cannot stop interrupting, I will often try to make the people around us laugh (never at the expense of the interrupter) to reassert my control over the space. “I made them laugh. I’ve got the floor. Let me finish, damn it.”
> 3. An early laugh lets the audience know that regardless of how serious, intense, or disturbing the story I am telling may be, I’m okay now. “I made you laugh. Everything is fine. Whatever horror I’m about to tell you about, it’s in the past.”

##### 2. Make 'em laugh before you make 'em cry
> The second time I make the audience laugh is just before the actual accident in my story. I want my audience to laugh here because we are seconds away from the collision. The contrast between their laughter and approaching horror heightens the shocking and visceral nature of what is about to happen. I often say that I like to make people laugh before making them cry, because it hurts more that way. Contrast is king in storytelling, and laughter can provide a fantastic contrast to something authentically awful.

##### 3. Take a breath
> The third time I make the audience laugh is immediately following the accident. I want my audience to laugh here because they have just endured the details of a horrific car accident, and I need to break the tension. The audience needs to take a breath. Whenever a story has become exceptionally tense and the audience needs to reset, a laugh is the best way to do this. 
> 
> That's the job of the storyteller. Make good, strategic choices, and then make the most of those choices.

##### 4. Stop crying so you can feel something else
> The last time I make the audience laugh is near the end of the story. This laugh is another opportunity for the audience to take a breath and reset. I need the audience to collect themselves for the final few lines, because I know they might cry again. Rather than weeping through the end of the story, I want them to cry twice, because each time it's for a slightly different reason. When your audience can feel those two separate and distinct feelings, separated by a laugh, the potential depth and meaning of the story increases considerably. Also, you don't want your audience weeping for long periods of time. It's not pretty.
> 
> You must end your story on heart. Far too often I hear storytellers attempt to end their story on a laugh. A pun. A joke. A play on words. This is not why we listen to stories. We like to laugh; we want to laugh. But we listen to stories to be moved. We love stories that contain moments of humor and hilarity. Sometimes an entire story can be funny. But those last few precious sentences — the space where you will land your story — should end with heart. Close with meaning. Stories must conclude with something greater than a laugh. If you want your story to linger with your audience (and that should be your goal), you should end in a place that is moving, vulnerable, or revealing, or establishes connection with the audience. Save your laughs for the middle, when you want to keep your audience engaged. Allow them to carry your audience to the end. But end your story with something bigger than a laugh.

##### Milk Cans and a Baseball
> Milk Cans and a Baseball refers to the carnival game where metallic milk cans are stacked in a triangular formation and the player attempts to knock them down with a ball. In comedy, this is called setup and punch line. The milk cans represent the setup, and the ball is the punch line. The more milk cans in your tower, the greater potential laugh. The better you deliver the ball, the more of that potential will be realized. The trick is to work to the laugh by using language that carefully builds your tower while saving the funniest thing for last. Sadly the instinct of most people is to say the funniest thing first. They can't wait to get to the funny part, and in doing so, they ruin it. 
> 
> Oddly specific words are also funny. It’s funnier for me to say, “I’m pouring water over Raisin Bran because I am too stupid and lazy to buy milk” than it is to say, “I’m pouring water over a bowl of cereal.” Why? Specificity is funny. 

##### Babies and Blenders
> Babies and Blenders is the idea that when two things that rarely or never go together are pushed together, humor often results. 
> 
> Exaggeration is another form of Babies and Blenders. We push an unreasonable description against something that doesn’t normally fit that description, and a laugh is the result. But this only works when everyone agrees that you’re exaggerating. If I’m falsely exaggerating in the attempt to make my audience believe that my exaggeration is accurate, that is not an exaggeration. It is a lie – an unacceptable one in my book.
