title: "Educational institutions fall short in developing essential problem-solving skills"

Despite the clear need for advanced problem-solving abilities ([[Problem solving is a vital skill in the 21st century]]), current methods of teaching in schools and universities are not adequately developing these skills. The nature of problem-solving goes beyond just applying the knowledge of reading, mathematics, and science. It requires the ability to deal with complexity and uncertainty (one more reason to start [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] and [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]), often when obvious solutions are not available. Critical thinking skills such as creativity, logic, and reasoning are fundamental to problem-solving and must be emphasized in education.

> If creative problem solving is the critical twenty‐first century skill, what are schools and universities doing to develop these skills in students? Not enough. It remains early days in codifying and disseminating problem solving best practices in educational institutions. Andreas Schleicher, Director of Education and Skills and Special Advisor to the Secretary General of the OECD, explains the need for developing problem solving skills in students this way: “Put simply, the world no longer rewards people just for what they know—Google knows everything—but for what they can do with what they know. Problem solving is at the heart of this, the capacity of an individual to engage in cognitive processing to understand and resolve problem situations where a method of solution is not immediately obvious.”

> One of the interesting early findings is that to teach students to become better problem solvers involves other capabilities than simply teaching reading, mathematics, and science literacy well. Capabilities such as creativity, logic, and reasoning are essential contributors to students becoming better problem solvers. That is what this book is about.
