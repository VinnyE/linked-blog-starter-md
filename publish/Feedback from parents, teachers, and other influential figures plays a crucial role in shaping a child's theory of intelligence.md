Feedback from parents, teachers, and other influential figures plays a crucial role in shaping a child's theory of intelligence ([[Entity and Incremental Theories of Intelligence]]). Entity theorists are usually praised or criticized based on their inherent abilities, such as being "smart" or "good at math". On the contrary, learning theorists receive process-oriented feedback that focuses on their effort and hard work, fostering a growth mindset.

Therefore, we should be careful with how we provide feedback to our children because [[Success and failure in different fields can be heavily influenced by an individual's theory of intelligence]].
