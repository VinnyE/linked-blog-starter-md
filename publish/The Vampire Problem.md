title: "The Vampire Problem"

The process of decision-making, particularly for life-altering choices , is akin to navigating uncharted territory with no map, where the future is obscured and the repercussions are beyond comprehension (see: [[Navigating wild problems shapes personal identity and growth and surfaces the inherent limits of rational decision-making]]). This complexity is epitomized by L. A. Paul's "Vampire Problem", a metaphor suggesting that life-changing decisions, much like deciding to become a vampire, can't truly be understood until experienced firsthand. We might be able to listen to others who have undergone similar transformations or changes, and while their experiences can provide valuable insight, they cannot guarantee how we, as individuals, will react or adapt.

Our identity and preferences evolve as we change, creating a conundrum: should our decisions be based on who we are now, or on the person we may become as a result of the decision? This poses a challenge when contemplating significant life decisions, such as marriage, parenthood, or changing religious affiliation. The crux of the problem lies in the fact that these decisions alter our existence in ways that are impossible to predict, influencing our attitudes, values, and sources of happiness or sorrow.

Take [[Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making]], for instance. His pros and cons list could only represent a limited perspective, informed by his unmarried state and observations of married life from an external viewpoint. This approach barely scratches the surface of the inner life of a married person, which is laden with deeply personal and transformative experiences. Darwin's list, thus, reflected more about him as an individual than the universal reality of marriage. 

As noted in the first chapter of [[Wild Problems]]:

> One answer to the challenge of wild problems is to try to measure what you can, and do your best to quantify what you can’t. That seems better than nothing, and the very process of gathering more information settles your nerves. You’re making progress toward the right answer, you tell yourself. You’re taking a step in the right direction. 
> 
> But it can be a step in the wrong direction. If you’re not careful, you’re like the person under the streetlight searching for lost keys. Did you lose them here? asks a passerby who volunteers to help. No, says the seeker, but the light’s better here. Using a flashlight to make the area under the streetlight even brighter might seem like a rational response, but if the keys are far from the light and deep in the shadows, you’re only fooling yourself into thinking you’re getting closer to finding them. 

(note to self: great metaphor for availability bias)

To fully comprehend these transformative experiences, one needs to peer into the inner worlds of those who have undergone the change (see: [[Navigate unfamiliar domains effectively by leveraging expertise and mental models]]). However, accessing these intimate narratives can be challenging. People often hesitate to share their personal experiences due to their private nature. Furthermore, many may lack self-awareness about how the experience has changed them. Others might be uncomfortable acknowledging the complexities and challenges inherent in these transformations. Lastly, even if one is willing and able to express their experiences, the intricacy of human emotions often defies simple articulation.

This draws attention to the inherent limits of rational decision-making when it comes to life-altering choices. Not only is it impossible to fully comprehend the benefits and costs until experienced, but it also raises the question of whose preferences should be prioritized: those of the individual before the transformation, or those of the transformed individual? Even if others seem content with their choices, there is no guarantee that we would experience the same level of satisfaction or fulfillment. Thus, these decisions often involve a leap of faith, trusting in the potential for growth and transformation inherent in life's unpredictable journey.

> When Darwin was trying to decide whether to marry, the information he really wanted was how his life would turn out if he decided to marry versus how it would turn out as a single man. Making a list of pluses and minuses when facing alternative universes is a way of trying to imagine what it will be like under each choice. This seems rational and is a version of trying to maximize what economists call expected utility—your expected well-being in the future.

> How do I tell Charles Darwin that he hasn’t gathered enough data? Like all of us, Darwin was in the dark about the future. And worse, like all of us facing a wild problem, Darwin was also in the dark about how much darkness surrounded him. In her book Transformative Experience, L. A. Paul uses the choice to become a vampire as a metaphor for the big decisions that are the focus of this book. Before you become a vampire, you can’t really imagine what it will be like. Your current experience doesn’t include what it’s like to subsist on blood and sleep in a coffin when the sun is shining. Sound dreary? But most, maybe all, of the vampires you meet speak quite highly of the experience. Surveys of vampires reveal a high degree of happiness.

> But will it be good for you—the actual you and not some average experienced by others—a flesh-and-blood human being who will live the experience in real time? Ah, different question. You have no data on that one. And the only way to get that data is to take the leap of faith (or in this case, anti-faith, maybe) into Vampire World. Once you’ve made the leap and find you don’t care for an all-liquid,

> One of the weirdest parts of the decision, as Paul points out, is that once you become a vampire, what you like and what you dislike change. As a human, you might find narcissism repugnant. But vampires find narcissism refreshing and look back on their humbler non-vampire selves with disdain for their humility. Which “you” should you consider when deciding what’s best for you? The current you or the you you will become?
> 
> It sounds silly, but it’s not that different from a lot of wild problems we face—whether to get married or have children or join a religion or leave the religion you grew up with. Many decisions involve burning bridges, crossing into a new experience that will change you in ways you can’t imagine, including what you care about and what brings you joy or sorrow, sweetness or sadness, sunshine or shade.

> Darwin’s list tells us more about Darwin than it does about marriage. His list of pluses and minuses—especially the pluses—is the list that someone would make who has never been married and has no access to the upside of the inner life of a married man. Darwin’s ignorance is part of the reason his negatives about marriage (banishment! degradation! idle fool!) are so emphatic and his positives are so mild (female chit-chat).

> Darwin’s list draws on the outer life of marriage. Like the person looking for lost keys under the glow of a streetlight, Darwin’s list draws on what he might have observed as a young man in what were inevitably brief encounters with married couples in relatively formal settings. Such encounters aren’t irrelevant. But the part of a marriage that is visible to an outsider is such a small part of the experience. Most married couples in the presence of others are much less likely to bicker or expose the flaws in their relationship. The bigger mystery isn’t what goes on behind closed doors when couples are free to be themselves, but rather what happens behind closed eyes when married men or women reflect on how marriage alters their sense of self and how that sense of self ripples through the rest of their experience of life.

> If, like Darwin, you’re wondering whether marriage or parenthood is for you, it’s not a bad idea to talk with your married friends if they’re willing to share something of the ups and downs. But the willingness of married people to share the experience of marriage is quite rare. First, it’s intensely personal. Intimate. Second, much of the time, we who are married may have little self-awareness of how marriage changes us. It’s not something we think much about unless we’re writing a book on it. Third, I think many married people are uneasy being honest about the ups and downs—they may feel inadequate admitting that their marriage isn’t a 24/7 lovefest of sexual and emotional bliss even to themselves, let alone to others.
> 
> And fourth, even if we’re aware, even if we’re willing to share, we would struggle to put those feelings into words. Not because the feelings aren’t real, or because married people become inarticulate once they tie the knot, but because the emotions surrounding human relationships are inevitably complex and nuanced.
