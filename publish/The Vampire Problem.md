When Darwin was torn between marriage and bachelorhood, he was essentially peering into alternative universes, trying to estimate his future well-being. This mirrors our own experiences with significant decisions—like turning into a vampire in a thought experiment—where we simply lack the data to accurately predict our changed selves post-decision. We find ourselves on the edge of a cliff, poised to plunge into an altered reality that may shift our preferences and even our identity. Darwin's musings on marriage are indicative of his limited outsider perspective, highlighting our struggle to grasp the profound inner transformations induced by major life decisions. Hence, while conversing with those who've walked the path can offer some insights, ultimately, these life-altering decisions remain deeply personal, convoluted, and elusive to articulate.

> When Darwin was trying to decide whether to marry, the information he really wanted was how his life would turn out if he decided to marry versus how it would turn out as a single man. Making a list of pluses and minuses when facing alternative universes is a way of trying to imagine what it will be like under each choice. This seems rational and is a version of trying to maximize what economists call expected utility—your expected well-being in the future.

> How do I tell Charles Darwin that he hasn’t gathered enough data? Like all of us, Darwin was in the dark about the future. And worse, like all of us facing a wild problem, Darwin was also in the dark about how much darkness surrounded him. In her book Transformative Experience, L. A. Paul uses the choice to become a vampire as a metaphor for the big decisions that are the focus of this book. Before you become a vampire, you can’t really imagine what it will be like. Your current experience doesn’t include what it’s like to subsist on blood and sleep in a coffin when the sun is shining. Sound dreary? But most, maybe all, of the vampires you meet speak quite highly of the experience. Surveys of vampires reveal a high degree of happiness.

> But will it be good for you—the actual you and not some average experienced by others—a flesh-and-blood human being who will live the experience in real time? Ah, different question. You have no data on that one. And the only way to get that data is to take the leap of faith (or in this case, anti-faith, maybe) into Vampire World. Once you’ve made the leap and find you don’t care for an all-liquid,

> One of the weirdest parts of the decision, as Paul points out, is that once you become a vampire, what you like and what you dislike change. As a human, you might find narcissism repugnant. But vampires find narcissism refreshing and look back on their humbler non-vampire selves with disdain for their humility. Which “you” should you consider when deciding what’s best for you? The current you or the you you will become?
> 
> It sounds silly, but it’s not that different from a lot of wild problems we face—whether to get married or have children or join a religion or leave the religion you grew up with. Many decisions involve burning bridges, crossing into a new experience that will change you in ways you can’t imagine, including what you care about and what brings you joy or sorrow, sweetness or sadness, sunshine or shade.

> Darwin’s list tells us more about Darwin than it does about marriage. His list of pluses and minuses—especially the pluses—is the list that someone would make who has never been married and has no access to the upside of the inner life of a married man. Darwin’s ignorance is part of the reason his negatives about marriage (banishment! degradation! idle fool!) are so emphatic and his positives are so mild (female chit-chat).

> Darwin’s list draws on the outer life of marriage. Like the person looking for lost keys under the glow of a streetlight, Darwin’s list draws on what he might have observed as a young man in what were inevitably brief encounters with married couples in relatively formal settings. Such encounters aren’t irrelevant. But the part of a marriage that is visible to an outsider is such a small part of the experience. Most married couples in the presence of others are much less likely to bicker or expose the flaws in their relationship. The bigger mystery isn’t what goes on behind closed doors when couples are free to be themselves, but rather what happens behind closed eyes when married men or women reflect on how marriage alters their sense of self and how that sense of self ripples through the rest of their experience of life.

> If, like Darwin, you’re wondering whether marriage or parenthood is for you, it’s not a bad idea to talk with your married friends if they’re willing to share something of the ups and downs. But the willingness of married people to share the experience of marriage is quite rare. First, it’s intensely personal. Intimate. Second, much of the time, we who are married may have little self-awareness of how marriage changes us. It’s not something we think much about unless we’re writing a book on it. Third, I think many married people are uneasy being honest about the ups and downs—they may feel inadequate admitting that their marriage isn’t a 24/7 lovefest of sexual and emotional bliss even to themselves, let alone to others.
> 
> And fourth, even if we’re aware, even if we’re willing to share, we would struggle to put those feelings into words. Not because the feelings aren’t real, or because married people become inarticulate once they tie the knot, but because the emotions surrounding human relationships are inevitably complex and nuanced.
