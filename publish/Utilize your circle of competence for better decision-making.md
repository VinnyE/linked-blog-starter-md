title: "Utilize your circle of competence for better decision-making"

The circle of competence is a mental model (see: [[What are mental models]]) which represents the areas of expertise and knowledge where an individual excels. It is the domain(s) that you're intimately familiar with and comfortable in making successful decisions that take into account multiple variables. Understanding and acknowledging one's circle of competence is crucial for making better decisions and achieving successful outcomes. It is important to recognize the limits of our knowledge and expertise, as well as where we have an edge over others. This awareness helps us identify our vulnerabilities and areas for improvement (see: [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]).

> When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes

The climate preserves their corpses, almost as a warning. The ascent to the summit takes you by the bodies of people who once shared your dreams. 

> How do you know when you have a circle of competence? Within our circles of competence, we know exactly what we don’t know. We are able to make decisions quickly and relatively accurately. We possess detailed knowledge of additional information we might need to make a decision with full understanding, or even what information is unobtainable. We know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two. We can anticipate and respond to objections because we’ve heard them before and already put in the work of gaining the knowledge to counter them. We also have a lot of options when we confront problems in our circles. Our deep fluency in subjects we are dealing with means we can draw on different information resources and understand what can be adjusted and what is invariant.
