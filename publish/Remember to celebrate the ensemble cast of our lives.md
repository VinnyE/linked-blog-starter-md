Our interactions with others form a complex dance of emotion and intent, often centered on the self as the main protagonist. Yet, adopting a more ensemble perspective, one that appreciates the narratives and needs of others, can lead to richer and more satisfying relationships. This transformation requires self-awareness and a pause before reacting, allowing for thoughtful consideration instead of instinctive responses. Seeing relationships not as contracts, with their focus on individual gain, but as covenants – promises of shared journeys – can further this shift. We can learn to mute the persistent "what's in it for me?" refrain and instead ask, "what do others need for our shared journey?" By reframing our lives from heroic solitary figures to members of an ensemble cast, we can find deeper meaning and connection in our relationships.

## Concept Breakdown

### Concept of the 'Self' in Interactions
We naturally see ourselves as the central characters in the narratives of our lives, assigning less significant roles to others. This inward focus, a function of our hardwired self-attention, can skew our interactions with others towards our own feelings and reactions. It's important to recognize this tendency and strive towards a more balanced perspective, one that considers the feelings and needs of others too.

### Importance of the Pause
Before we react to a situation or an interaction, inserting a pause can allow for reflection and thoughtfulness. This pause can remind us that our natural responses are often mediated by our personal fears, desires, and needs. It can help us to step out of our habitual scripts and consider more thoughtful and considerate responses.

### From Contract to Covenant
Relationships can be seen as either contracts, where the focus lies on personal benefit and score-keeping, or covenants, promises of shared experiences and journeys. Covenant relationships do not revolve around the question of getting one's "fair share," but rather, they emphasize shared experiences and the enjoyment of the ride. This perspective reframes sacrifices as satisfying habits and fosters a sense of loyalty and commitment.

### The Ensemble Perspective
Shifting our perception from viewing ourselves as the main character in the narrative of our lives to one of many in an ensemble cast can transform our relationships. In this perspective, friends, family, and colleagues are seen as partners in our journey, not mere supporting characters. This shift allows us to appreciate the richness and diversity of our shared experiences and creates a more meaningful drama of life.

>  Playing well with others—being a good friend or spouse or colleague—is a wild problem we confront every day, trying to balance our work or our desire to be by ourselves with the desires of the people around us to spend time together. How does a focus on flourishing help us deal with this tension? How can we be better friends, better spouses, better colleagues? Getting over yourself is a good place to start—being aware that you’re not the center of the universe. That requires some level of self-awareness—being aware of how your actions and words affect others and how you’re perceived. 

>  At its best, what meditation or therapy or religion can do is to allow a pause before the response. That pause can help you realize that what is really going on is not always captured by the words. The pause can remind you that you can step out of the script that you might otherwise be stuck in. The pause can remind you that your natural response is mediated by your own fears, desires, and needs. The pause can remind you that you can step out of your habitual response and be more considerate or thoughtful. With practice, you can change your habitual response to a better one. 

> If I’m always asking, What’s in it for me?—What benefit will I enjoy, and is it greater than the cost?—it’s harder to notice how I interact with others and how the way I’m behaving may not be considerate of what they might need from me.

> Because we're hardwired to think about ourselves more than we think about others, we have this internal drama called "the story of my life" going 24/7 on our inner video screens. So it's normal to think of yourself as the main character of the drama that is your life and everyone else around you as the supporting cast. This narrative fills our headspace and in turn affects howe experience our day-to-day lives. It is the way we make sense of what happens to us and what we hope will happen in the future. These narratives are inevitably incomplete. As the scriptwriters, we tend to fashion our inner narratives in ways that focus on ourselves, and in ways that are not necessarily accurate.

>  Our natural impulse to see ourselves as the main character inevitably assigns less important roles to those around us. 

> We relate to other people, but not on an exactly equal footing. If I’m not careful, it’s about how I feel more than about what you feel. If I’m not careful, it’s about how your actions affect me and not the other way around. And even when my role is just someone in the chorus, I inevitably make it seem bigger than it really is. I inevitably take myself a little too seriously. I inevitably underestimate your role and find it hard to remember that you, too, have emotions and drama in your own life apart from mine. It’s hard not to pose and preen and say my handful of lines a little louder than I should.

> Seeing yourself as the main character doesn't make you a narcissist. Even the most humble among us, the shyest among us, tend to focus inward on the inevitable centrality of our own experiences and our distorted, imperfect memories of our past.

> Here’s a different way to go through life. To get at the alternative, think about an ensemble cast for a sitcom or a series. In a show like Friends, there’s no star, no main character. There’s just a bunch of people weaving in and out of one another’s lives. The show may be called Seinfeld, but he’s not the main character. There are four main characters. The show is about their relationships, not just the narrative arc of Jerry’s life. Or think of the movie Love Actually. A star-studded cast but no one’s the star of the movie. It’s a story about love and connection, not the adventures of a central protagonist.

>  We have a choice in how we perceive and frame our daily experiences. One choice is to see ourselves as fundamentally atomistic, heroic, and existentially lonely. The other is to see ourselves as connected and belonging to something, with that belonging at the center of the experience. How we frame the before, during, and after of our experiences changes how our daily experiences become part of us.

> Rather than see your friends and family as objects to serve your goals and increase your utility, see them as partners you commit to with no agenda as to what might emerge from interacting with them. View the chance to interact with them as more of an exploration and adventure than a scripted drama. Allow another human being the chance to open their heart. That can turn out to be a much more meaningful drama than the one where you’re the main character, even if it means giving up control of the process.

> In a way, all of this is just an obvious cliche–friends and family make life meaningful. So treat them well. We all know that. But if we know that, why do we glance down at our phone in the middle of a conversation with one of our children because we've received a notification or an alert? Why do we look over the shoulder of the person we're talking to at a party to see if there is someone more interesting, or worse, someone more useful to us in achieving some goal? Why do we often fail to make sufficient time to do things with out friends that offer no immediate benefit to us? Why do we let friends drift away and miss a chance to stay connected? But most of all, why do we give in to our natural impulse and see ourselves as the main character? If we can see our life alongside friends and family and colleagues as more of an ensemble we are fortunate to be part of, we’ll treat them better and even treat ourselves better. “Better” isn’t really the right word. Daily life will have a different texture—one that is richer and more satisfying.

> Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote often about the difference between a contract and a covenant. With a contract, it’s all about what’s in it for me. In a contractual relationship, you keep score. You worry about being exploited. That makes for a bad marriage and a bad friendship. A covenant, on the other hand, is a promise. A covenant says: we’re together. Because of the commitment behind a covenant, you can afford to let your interactions with another person be free of making sure you get your “fair share.” You can enjoy the ride. You keep commitments not out of fear that the other person will exploit you but because you want to be the kind of person whose commitments can be counted on. Sacks said that marriage turns love into loyalty. That commitment takes both parties beyond what's in it for me.
>  
>  With a contract, it’s easy to feel the other people aren’t living up to their commitments at the level you expected. With a contract, you can easily imagine not renewing when the contract expires. It’s just a transaction and maybe you can find a better deal somewhere else. But with a covenant, your friends and family aren’t objects for you to exploit for more gain. They’re partners on your journey through life. Instead of wondering and worrying whether you are getting enough out of the relationship, you enjoy the shared experience. And if you are really lucky or work at it very hard, you privilege the principle of the covenant sufficiently so that sacrifices are no longer sacrifices. They may feel that way at first. But you can build a habit of partnership and turn a sacrifice into a satisfying habit. By reframing how we see our own lives—less as the story of a heroic figure and more of an ensemble—we can be better friends, better spouses, and more fully human.

> In the choir of life, don’t be a diva. Lower your voice and revel in the harmony. On the dance floor of life, make room for the other dancers and let your partner shine. Try to be aware of your natural impulse to ask, what’s in it for me, and make room instead for what the people around you need for the journey we’re all in together.
