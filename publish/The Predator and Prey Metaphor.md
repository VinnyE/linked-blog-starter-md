title: The Predator and Prey Metaphor

This metaphor illustrates the power of mental clarity and focus. When one is fully present and focused ("the predator"), they have a clear advantage over those who are distracted by internal issues ("the prey"). This dynamic is critical in competitive scenarios as well as solitary activities, where self-monitoring is key.
