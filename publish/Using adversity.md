World-class performers share a key trait: they're able to face challenges head-on, not run from them. They learn to flow with whatever life throws at them, using it to their advantage. Over time, they even create their own exciting challenges or "earthquakes," fuelling their mental processes without needing an external push. Pain or discomfort aren't obstacles but opportunities for these achievers to grow stronger and more resilient. Instead of suppressing emotions, they learn to understand them, make peace with them, and eventually channel them to boost their performance. Keeping cool under pressure, they're always ready to apply their knowledge effectively, make precise decisions, and take positive action, even in the most complicated situations.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Three-Step Process of Performance Training
Performance training involves a three-phase process. First, learners must develop the ability to flow with unexpected circumstances. Second, they need to transform these circumstances into advantageous situations. The final phase is achieving self-sufficiency by creating their own challenges or "earthquakes" for stimulation, removing reliance on external factors.

### The Power of Mental Resilience
Mental resilience, a vital trait for high performers, goes beyond simply withstanding hardships. It involves a positive engagement with discomfort and pain, seeking ways to adapt and grow from these experiences. This trait can be continuously nurtured, strengthening the mind to become more impervious to disturbances.

### Emotional Mastery for Enhanced Performance
The emotional landscape need not be a disruptive force. By developing an understanding of emotions, making peace with them, and eventually harnessing them, performers can channel their emotional energy into improving their performance levels.

### Maintaining Equanimity Under Pressure
Maintaining composure under stress is essential to optimal performance. A calm and collected state allows performers to apply their knowledge fully, arrive at precise decisions, and take effective actions, especially in complex and critical situations.

> In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.

> Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. When injured, which happens frequently in the life of a martial artist, I try to avoid painkillers and to change the sensation of pain into a feeling that is not necessarily negative. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.

> Being able to handle life’s dirty tricks without losing one’s equanimity, interest, and joy is vital to learning and achievement. The ability to call on one’s knowledge and apply it well and completely is disrupted when we fall prey to emotional disturbances. Rather than deny or stifle emotions, we must work to gain an understanding of them, learn to make peace with them, and ultimately, channel them into higher levels of performance. By keeping our cool under trying conditions, we can arrive at precise conclusions and take positive and effective action at all times, especially during the most complicated and critical moments. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/resilience/using-adversity/
