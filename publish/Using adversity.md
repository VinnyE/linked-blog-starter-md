Handling life's adversities without sacrificing one's calmness, enthusiasm, and joy is essential for learning and personal achievement. Emotional turbulence can disrupt the application of one's knowledge, so instead of suppressing these emotions, it is vital to understand, accept, and harness them to enhance performance. By maintaining composure during difficult situations, we are better equipped to reach accurate conclusions and make positive, effective decisions, particularly in the face of complex and critical circumstances.

Performance training involves a progression of steps. Initially, one learns to adapt and flow with whatever life presents. The next step is to leverage these circumstances to one's benefit. Finally, the ultimate goal is to achieve a level of self-sufficiency where one can instigate their own metaphorical earthquakes, cultivating a mental process that generates inspiration without external stimuli.

Mental resilience is a crucial characteristic of top performers, requiring continuous cultivation. The objective should always be to build psychological fortitude. When discomfort arises, the instinct should not be to evade it, but to find peace within it. For example, in a physically demanding discipline like martial arts, injuries are common. Instead of resorting to painkillers, one can learn to interpret the sensation of pain differently, turning it into a feeling that isn't necessarily negative. The drive should always be to seek challenges rather than shying away from them. This approach fosters strength, resilience, and an unyielding pursuit of personal growth and achievement.

> In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.

> Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. When injured, which happens frequently in the life of a martial artist, I try to avoid painkillers and to change the sensation of pain into a feeling that is not necessarily negative. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.

> Being able to handle life’s dirty tricks without losing one’s equanimity, interest, and joy is vital to learning and achievement. The ability to call on one’s knowledge and apply it well and completely is disrupted when we fall prey to emotional disturbances. Rather than deny or stifle emotions, we must work to gain an understanding of them, learn to make peace with them, and ultimately, channel them into higher levels of performance. By keeping our cool under trying conditions, we can arrive at precise conclusions and take positive and effective action at all times, especially during the most complicated and critical moments. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/resilience/using-adversity/
