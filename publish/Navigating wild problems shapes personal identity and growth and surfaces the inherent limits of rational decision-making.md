title: "Navigating wild problems shapes personal identity and growth and surfaces the inherent limits of rational decision-making"

Life presents us with wild problems, pivotal decisions shrouded in uncertainty, each choice shaping our identity and future. Unlike tame problems, wild ones are complex and unpredictable, making it difficult to use standard reasoning. Historically, authority and tradition guided us through these decisions, but as their influence wanes, we're often left in the dark. A common approach is to quantify what's possible and reassure ourselves that we're moving towards an answer. However, this can be misleading, like using a streetlight to find keys lost in the dark - just because the light is better doesn't mean the keys are there. Instead of seeking the 'right' decision, we must embrace the inherent uncertainty and consider the full range of choices that life offers.

## Concept Breakdown

### Wild Problems
Wild problems are the significant, life-altering decisions we encounter, where the outcomes are unclear, and each choice can significantly influence our identity and future. Unlike other, more manageable issues, these problems are complex, unpredictable, and defy standard approaches to problem-solving.

### The Decline of Authority and Tradition
For much of human history, authority and tradition helped guide us through wild problems. But as the influence of kings, religion, and established cultural norms diminishes, we often find ourselves navigating these challenges without their guidance.

### The Misleading Comfort of Quantification
In the face of wild problems, it's tempting to measure and quantify what we can in the hopes of making the best decision. This process can provide a comforting illusion of progress. However, focusing solely on what we can measure can often lead us astray.

### The Illusion of the Right Decision
Many of us are conditioned to believe that there's always a 'right' decision waiting to be uncovered. But with wild problems, this is often not the case. These problems require us to embrace the inherent uncertainty and be open to the full range of possible choices.

### The Streetlight Effect
The Streetlight Effect illustrates the human tendency to search for answers where it's easiest, not necessarily where they are. In trying to solve wild problems, we might focus on the most illuminated, quantifiable aspects, ignoring the vast range of possibilities hidden in the shadows of the unknown.

> Whether to have a child is what I call a wild problem—a fork in the road of life where knowing which path is the right one isn’t obvious, where the pleasure and pain from choosing one path over another are ultimately hidden from us, where the path we choose defines who we are and who we might become. Wild problems are the big decisions all of us have to deal with as we go through life. 

> But wild problems resist measurement. What works for you might not work for me, and what worked for me yesterday might not work for me tomorrow. Wild problems are untamed, undomesticated, spontaneous, organic, complex. They’re a whole different beast compared to the tame problems where the standard techniques of rationality move us steadily forward.

> Through most of human history, authority and tradition—the kings who ruled us, our parents, the religion we were born into, the culture surrounding us—tamed the wild problems we faced. The kings are dead. Religion’s hold steadily loosens.

> By focusing on what you know about and can imagine, you’re ignoring the full range of choices open to you.

> Instead of spending more time trying to make the right decision, I show you that often there is no right decision in the way we usually think of the term. 

> One answer to the challenge of wild problems is to try to measure what you can, and do your best to quantify what you can’t. That seems better than nothing, and the very process of gathering more information settles your nerves. You’re making progress toward the right answer, you tell yourself. You’re taking a step in the right direction.

> But it can be a step in the wrong direction. If you’re not careful, you’re like the person under the streetlight searching for lost keys. Did you lose them here? asks a passerby who volunteers to help. No, says the seeker, but the light’s better here. Using a flashlight to make the area under the streetlight even brighter might seem like a rational response, but if the keys are far from the light and deep in the shadows, you’re only fooling yourself into thinking you’re getting closer to finding them. By focusing on what you know about and can imagine, you’re ignoring the full range of choices open to you.
