Making significant life choices, such as the decision to have a child or perhaps settle down and get married with our partner, often presents us with what can be termed as 'wild problems.' **Wild problems are critical junctures in our lives that possess the power to shape our identities, yet they are cloaked in ambiguity.** The impact of choosing one path over the other is shrouded, neither completely visible nor readily quantifiable. What may prove to be a fulfilling choice for one person may not bear the same fruit for another, and what seemed right at one moment may seem questionable at another. This lack of clarity and consistency makes these wild problems inherently resistant to measurement and uniquely challenging.

Unlike ordinary problems that can be solved systematically through logical reasoning (see: [[Problem solving is a vital skill in the 21st century]] & frameworks like [[The bulletproof problem solving framework]]), wild problems are essentially uncharted territories. They are spontaneous, complex, organic, and display a rich tapestry of characteristics that defy conventional methods of problem-solving. For example, see [[The Vampire Problem]].

Historically, these problems were often tamed by societal authorities or traditional structures, such as rulers, religion, culture, or familial beliefs. However, with the evolution of societies and shifting cultural norms, these traditional agents of control have become less influential. Consequently, these wild problems have remained undomesticated, contributing further to their complexity.

*(side note: The ultimatum on Netflix is basically a show built entirely on the wild problem of "should I get married to this person?".  A lot of reality shows are actually entertaining because of the wild problems they present.)*

A common pitfall in dealing with such wild problems is the tendency to focus narrowly on familiar possibilities, ignoring the full spectrum of available choices (see: [[Avoiding common pitfalls is key to effective problem solving]]). This results in a limited perception of the issue at hand, which can lead to inadequate decision-making. (Related: [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]])

Furthermore, it's important to embrace the reality that with wild problems, there might not always be a 'right' decision in the conventional sense. The inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of these issues mean that the value of a decision may lie not just in its immediate outcome, but also in the insights, personal growth, and experiences it yields along the way. Therefore, striving for the right decision can sometimes be less productive than focusing on the journey that unfolds from each choice and the unique impact it has on shaping who we become. For more on this, see [[Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making]].

> Whether to have a child is what I call a wild problem—a fork in the road of life where knowing which path is the right one isn’t obvious, where the pleasure and pain from choosing one path over another are ultimately hidden from us, where the path we choose defines who we are and who we might become. Wild problems are the big decisions all of us have to deal with as we go through life. 

> But wild problems resist measurement. What works for you might not work for me, and what worked for me yesterday might not work for me tomorrow. Wild problems are untamed, undomesticated, spontaneous, organic, complex. They’re a whole different beast compared to the tame problems where the standard techniques of rationality move us steadily forward.

> Through most of human history, authority and tradition—the kings who ruled us, our parents, the religion we were born into, the culture surrounding us—tamed the wild problems we faced. The kings are dead. Religion’s hold steadily loosens.

> By focusing on what you know about and can imagine, you’re ignoring the full range of choices open to you.

> Instead of spending more time trying to make the right decision, I show you that often there is no right decision in the way we usually think of the term. 

> One answer to the challenge of wild problems is to try to measure what you can, and do your best to quantify what you can’t. That seems better than nothing, and the very process of gathering more information settles your nerves. You’re making progress toward the right answer, you tell yourself. You’re taking a step in the right direction.

> But it can be a step in the wrong direction. If you’re not careful, you’re like the person under the streetlight searching for lost keys. Did you lose them here? asks a passerby who volunteers to help. No, says the seeker, but the light’s better here. Using a flashlight to make the area under the streetlight even brighter might seem like a rational response, but if the keys are far from the light and deep in the shadows, you’re only fooling yourself into thinking you’re getting closer to finding them. By focusing on what you know about and can imagine, you’re ignoring the full range of choices open to you.
