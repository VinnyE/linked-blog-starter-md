To be truly creative, we need to challenge conventional wisdom and break down concepts into their fundamental principles. Relying on others' ideas and methods without understanding the rationale behind them can limit innovation and lead to costly mistakes. One way we can do this is by relying on [[First principles thinking and its evolving nature]]. 

First principles thinking enables us to analyze situations independently, identify underlying principles, and determine if existing methods are effective. Contrary to popular belief, creativity is not an innate trait exclusive to certain individuals; rather, it can be nurtured and developed. By adopting first principles thinking and looking beyond societal conventions, we give ourselves a better chance of realizing our creative potential and broaden our perspectives, making previously unimaginable solutions possible.

Good role models for this type of thinking: Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk.

>  If we never learn to take something apart, test our assumptions about it, and reconstruct it, we end up bound by what other people tell us—trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same, making costly mistakes along the way. 

> To improve something, we need to understand why it is successful or not. Otherwise, we are just copying thoughts or behaviors without understanding why they worked. First principles thinking helps us avoid the problem of relying on someone else’s tactics without understanding the rationale behind them. Even incremental improvement is harder to achieve if we can’t identify the first principles.

> Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. When you really understand the principles at work, you can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t. Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true. We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for yourself. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. 

> The discovery that a bacterium, not stress, actually caused the majority of stomach ulcers is a great example of what can be accomplished when we push past assumptions to get at first principles.
