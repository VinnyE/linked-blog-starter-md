Mistaking the map for reality can lead to overconfidence and failure to adapt to a changing environment (see: [[Using flawed models leads to suboptimal decisions and repeated mistakes]]). As reality evolves, our understanding must also adapt to maintain accuracy. Good maps are built through feedback loops created by explorers who share their experiences and knowledge. Continuously updating maps and models allows us to adapt to a changing environment and make well-informed decisions (see: [[Reveal reality through the lens of mental models]]) while being aware that [[Maps and models simplify complexity with inherent limitations]]. 

Continuously updating our maps give us the best chance at following [[Charlie Munger]]'s advice: [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]

> When we mistake the map for reality, we start to think we have all the answers. We create static rules or policies that deal with the map but forget that we exist in a constantly changing world. When we close off or ignore feedback loops, we don’t see the terrain has changed and we dramatically reduce our ability to adapt to a changing environment. Reality is messy and complicated, so our tendency to simplify it is understandable. However, if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions. 

> If the value of a map or model is related to its ability to predict or explain, then it needs to represent reality. If reality has changed the map must change.

> territories change, sometimes faster than the maps and models that describe them. We can and should update them based on our own experiences in the territory. That’s how good maps are built: feedback loops created by explorers
