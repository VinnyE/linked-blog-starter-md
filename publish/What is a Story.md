When we discuss storytelling, we are focusing on the power of personal narratives rather than traditional fables or folktales. Personal narratives foster deeper connections with listeners, as they present the speaker in a vulnerable and authentic light, unveiling their most profound truths. For a narrative to be a personal story, it must meet three criteria. First, it should showcase change, representing a transformation in the storyteller, however subtle. Second, the narrative should be the storyteller's own, enabling the audience to connect with the speaker's experience directly. Finally, it must pass the Dinner Test, where the story remains authentic and relatable, whether shared casually at a dinner or presented on a stage, capturing the essence of raw, personal storytelling and not a theatrical performance.

## Concept Breakdown

### Personal Narrative Vs. Traditional Storytelling
The power of personal narratives far surpasses that of traditional fables or folktales. Unlike the latter, personal narratives connect the storyteller to the audience on a deeper level, revealing their most intimate truths. They invite listeners into the speaker's world, creating a bond that traditional storytelling can't achieve.

### Change in Storytelling
Change is a fundamental element of a personal narrative. A story is more than a string of remarkable events. It's about transformation over time. Even the slightest change in the speaker matters, as it portrays a journey, distinguishing a story from mere anecdotes or recollections.

### Ownership of the Narrative
Personal narratives must be exactly that - personal. They should be the storyteller's own stories, not borrowed from others. This ownership creates an immediacy, an authenticity, and vulnerability that compels listeners. It allows them to live the experiences of the speaker, making the narrative raw and real.

### The Dinner Test
The Dinner Test is a litmus test for personal narratives. It checks whether the story is crafted as naturally as you would narrate it to a friend at dinner. There should be minimal difference between the stage version and the casual, dinner-party version of your story. The aim is not a theatrical performance, but a genuine sharing of experiences, maintaining the authenticity and relatability inherent in personal storytelling.

> Let’s also be clear that when I talk about storytelling, I am speaking about personal narrative. True stories told by the people who lived them. This is very different than the traditional fable or folktale that many people associate with the word storytelling. While folktales and fables are entertaining and can teach us about universal truths and important life lessons, there is power in personal storytelling that folktales and fables will never possess. 

> You can't become the life of the party by telling a good folktale.

> Most importantly, folktales and fables do not create the same level of connection between storyteller and audience as a personal story. I have never listened to someone tell a folktale and felt more deeply connected to the storyteller as a result. I may have loved the story and admired the storyteller's skill and expertise, and I might have been highly entertained, but I have never felt that I knew the storyteller any better at the end of their story. The storyteller who tells folktales and fables is a highly developed, highly skilled delivery mechanism, often more entertaining than television, radio, or a YouTube video, but never revealing, vulnerable, or authentic. 

> We tell stories to express our hardest, best, most authentic truths. This is what brings thousands of people to hear stories at theaters and bars every night in cities all over the world. 

> There are a few requirements to ensuring that you are telling a personal story:
> 
> **Change**
		- Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series of remarkable events. You must start out as one version of yourself and end as something new. The change can be infinitesimal. It need not reflect an improvement in yourself or your character, but change must happen.
		- Stories that fail to reflect change over time are known as anecdotes. Romps. Drinking stories. Vacation stories. They recount humorous, harrowing, and even heartfelt moments from our lives that burned brightly but left no lasting mark on our souls. There is nothing wrong with telling these stories, but don't expect to make someone fall in love with you in a Chili's restaurant by telling one of these stories. 
   **Your story only**
		- You must tell your own story and not the stories of others. People would rather hear the story about what happened to you last night than about what happened to your friend Pete last night, even if Pete's story is better than your own. There is immediacy and grit and inherent vulnerability in hearing the story of someone standing before you. It's visceral and real.
		- This doesn't mean you can't tell someone else's story. It simply means you must make the story about yourself. You must tell your side of the story.
		- A story is like a diamond with many facets. Everyone has a different relationship to it. If you can find a way of making your particular facet of the story compelling, you can tell that story as your own. Otherwise, leave the telling to someone else. 
   **The Dinner Test**
		- Lastly, the story must pass the Dinner Test. The Dinner Test is simply this: Is the story that you craft for the stage, the boardroom, the sales conference, or the Sunday sermon similar to the story you would tell a friend at dinner? This should be the goal. 
		- The performance version of your story and the casual, dinner-party version of your story should be kissing cousins. Different, for sure, but not terribly different. 
		- If you wouldn’t tell your story at dinner that way, for goodness’ sake don’t tell it onstage that way. Storytelling is not theater. It is not poetry. It should be a slightly more crafted version of the story you would tell your buddies over beers.
		- The audience wants to feel that they are being told a story. They don't want to see someone perform a story.
