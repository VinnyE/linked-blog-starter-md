The first step to understanding a problem is to be able to accurately describe the full scope of the situation. To see a problem for what it is, we first need to break it down into substantive parts. Only by understanding the most basic elements first do the interconnections and causal relationships eventually reveal themselves (see: [[First principles thinking]]). Applying various mental model lenses (see: [[What are mental models]]) illuminates these connections and helps us see more of reality. This is why [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] is useful. 

It's important to remember that this process is always on-going. We must [[Overcome obstacles to learning from reality]]. Constantly testing understanding against reality is essential for refining mental models and adapting to new information. A useful mental model to consider here is [[Bayesian thinking]].

>In order to see a problem for what it is, we must first break it down into its substantive parts so the interconnections can reveal themselves. This bottom-up perspective allows us to expose what we believe to be the causal relationships and how they will govern the situation both now and in the future. Being able to accurately describe the full scope of a situation is the first step to understanding it. Using the lenses of our mental models helps us illuminate these interconnections. The more lenses used on a given problem, the more of reality reveals itself. The more of reality we see, the more we understand. The more we understand, the more we know what to do.

> Understanding must constantly be tested against reality and updated accordingly. This isnâ€™t a box we can tick, a task with a definite beginning and end, but a continuous process. (Antaeus and Heracles example)
