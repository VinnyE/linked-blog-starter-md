title:  "Reveal reality through the lens of mental models"

The first step in understanding a problem is accurately describing the full scope of the situation. To truly grasp a problem, we need to break it down into its fundamental components. By comprehending the basic elements, we can unveil the interconnections and causal relationships (see: [[First principles thinking and its evolving nature]]). Applying various mental models (see: [[What are mental models]]) helps highlight these connections and allows us to perceive more of reality. That's why [[Embracing Munger's multidisciplinary latticework of mental models]] is beneficial.

Remember, the more accurately our models represent reality, the more they improve our thought process (see: [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]). Once we understand a problem, we can better anticipate second, third, and fourth-order consequences, guiding us in choosing actions to take or avoid (see: [[Wisdom is prevention and avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them]]). [[The true value of comprehension emerges when it leads to meaningful changes in our actions and behavior]]

Understanding is not a one-time action. We must continually test our understanding against reality to refine mental models and adapt to new information. A helpful mental model to consider in this context is [[Bayesian thinking]].

>In order to see a problem for what it is, we must first break it down into its substantive parts so the interconnections can reveal themselves. This bottom-up perspective allows us to expose what we believe to be the causal relationships and how they will govern the situation both now and in the future. Being able to accurately describe the full scope of a situation is the first step to understanding it. Using the lenses of our mental models helps us illuminate these interconnections. The more lenses used on a given problem, the more of reality reveals itself. The more of reality we see, the more we understand. The more we understand, the more we know what to do.

> Better models mean better thinking. The degree to which our models accurately explain reality is the degree to which they improve our thinking. Understanding reality is the name of the game. Understanding not only helps us decide which actions to take but helps us remove or avoid actions that have a big downside that we would otherwise not be aware of. Not only do we understand the immediate problem with more accuracy, but we can begin to see the second-, third-, and higher-order consequences. This understanding helps us eliminate avoidable errors. Sometimes making good decisions boils down to avoiding bad ones

> What Can the Three Buckets of Knowledge Teach Us About History? “Every statistician knows that a large, relevant sample size is their best friend. What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles? Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It’s all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior. Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.” —Peter Kaufman
