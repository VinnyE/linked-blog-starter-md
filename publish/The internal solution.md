The journey of self-integration and mastery involves embracing and harnessing our emotional realities rather than denying or being controlled by them. In the early stages of personal growth, it's common to be swayed by intense emotions or to attempt to suppress them. However, the development of self-awareness through practices such as meditation enables us to observe our emotions and understand how they can either contribute to or detract from our creativity and overall state of being.

Having an understanding of our emotional reality enables us to approach life's challenges with more nuance. For instance, in the realm of competitive sports, it's critical to confront our psychological reactions to perceived unfairness, transforming our gut reactions into intensity and focus. To be truly authentic in any performance or creative endeavor, we must be true to our core personality and passions, else our work will ring hollow.

Recognizing and accepting our emotional nature is akin to navigating a thorny path. Rather than attempting to cover the entire path with leather, it's more practical and beneficial to craft sandals; in other words, to equip ourselves with the tools to effectively manage our internal landscape. This mirrors the learning process in performance training. Initially, we learn to adapt to whatever comes our way, gradually leveraging these situations to our advantage. Ultimately, we aim to be self-reliant, creating our own stimuli to fuel inspiration.

Once we are comfortable with our emotions and are able to sit with them, we can transform the physiological responses they elicit into means of overcoming obstacles. Developing a deep understanding of our emotional turbulence and fostering a tolerance for it, allows us to channel these emotions into creative inspiration and effective action. Once we are no longer destabilized by our emotional responses, we can harness their energy to navigate life's challenges and fuel our pursuits.

> Returning to my own experience, I have steadily worked on integrating my natural emotions into creative states of inspiration. Of course there were stages to this process. As a teenager I was thrown off by emotion and tried to block it out. Then, in my early twenties, during my initial experiments with Buddhist and Taoist meditation, I worked on letting my emotions pass like a cloud. This was interesting as it opened up a working relationship with my emotional reality very much like how I described working with the unconscious in the chapter Slowing Down Time. Instead of being dominated by or denying my passions, I slowly learned how to observe them and feel how they infused my moment with creativity, freshness, or darkness. Once I had a working relationship with my emotions, I began to take on my psychological reaction to foul play in the martial arts with a bit more subtlety. I believe that at the highest levels, performers and artists must be true to themselves. There can be no denial, no repression of true personality, or else the creation will be false—the performer will be alienated from his or her intuitive voice. I am a passionate guy. The fact of the matter is that I don’t particularly like dirty players. Their relationships to competition, to ego, to sport, to art, to violence, to foul play—it all rubs me the wrong way. The next step in my training would be to channel my gut reaction into intensity. This is not so hard once you get comfortable in that heated-up place. It is more about sweeping away the cobwebs than about learning anything new. We are built to be sharpest when in danger, but protected lives have distanced us from our natural abilities to channel our energies. Instead of running from our emotions or being swept away by their initial gusts, we should learn to sit with them, become at peace with their unique flavors, and ultimately discover deep pools of inspiration. I have found that this is a natural process. Once we build our tolerance for turbulence and are no longer upended by the swells of our emotional life, we can ride them and even pick up speed with their slopes.

> The first obstacle I had to overcome as a young chess player was to avoid being distracted by random, unexpected events- by the mini-earthquakes that afflict all of our days. In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.

> If we can prevent ourselves from being thrown by heightened emotions and instead learn to flow with them, the physiological responses they produce in us can help us defeat obstacles. To harness feelings for a defined purpose, we must first develop an understanding of and tolerance for inner turmoil. We should learn to observe our passions; understand their sources and their unique character. Then we will be able to transform them into creative inspiration for successful action. Once we have an in-depth awareness of our personality and the ways we react to external stimuli, we can use our minds to evoke a powerful internal physiological state at will and channel it to great advantage. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/resilience/the-internal-solution/
