In the roller coaster ride of life, emotions can seem like unexpected jolts that knock us off our tracks. But what if we could use these emotional swells to our advantage? As we grow up, we learn not to block or avoid emotions, but rather to ride them like waves, turning them into fresh inspiration. This involves making friends with our emotional life and using our gut reactions to channel our energy and intensify our performance. We can think of it like walking on a thorny road: instead of trying to cover the whole path with leather, we make sandals - we equip ourselves to deal with the challenges. As we become better at harnessing our emotions, we not only react to life's mini-earthquakes but also learn to create our own tremors, using our minds to stir up powerful states that fuel our action. It's all about understanding our inner turmoil, and transforming it into a creative force.

## Concept Breakdown

[[Emotion Management and Self-awareness]]

[[The process of channeling our gut reactions into intensity is a natural human ability, often obscured by the comforts of modern living]]

[[Once we understand our emotions and how to channel them, we can generate our own emotional states and use them to our advantage]]

[[Emotions, rather than distracting us, can be harnessed to help us overcome obstacle]]

> Returning to my own experience, I have steadily worked on integrating my natural emotions into creative states of inspiration. Of course there were stages to this process. As a teenager I was thrown off by emotion and tried to block it out. Then, in my early twenties, during my initial experiments with Buddhist and Taoist meditation, I worked on letting my emotions pass like a cloud. This was interesting as it opened up a working relationship with my emotional reality very much like how I described working with the unconscious in the chapter Slowing Down Time. Instead of being dominated by or denying my passions, I slowly learned how to observe them and feel how they infused my moment with creativity, freshness, or darkness. Once I had a working relationship with my emotions, I began to take on my psychological reaction to foul play in the martial arts with a bit more subtlety. I believe that at the highest levels, performers and artists must be true to themselves. There can be no denial, no repression of true personality, or else the creation will be false—the performer will be alienated from his or her intuitive voice. I am a passionate guy. The fact of the matter is that I don’t particularly like dirty players. Their relationships to competition, to ego, to sport, to art, to violence, to foul play—it all rubs me the wrong way. The next step in my training would be to channel my gut reaction into intensity. This is not so hard once you get comfortable in that heated-up place. It is more about sweeping away the cobwebs than about learning anything new. We are built to be sharpest when in danger, but protected lives have distanced us from our natural abilities to channel our energies. Instead of running from our emotions or being swept away by their initial gusts, we should learn to sit with them, become at peace with their unique flavors, and ultimately discover deep pools of inspiration. I have found that this is a natural process. Once we build our tolerance for turbulence and are no longer upended by the swells of our emotional life, we can ride them and even pick up speed with their slopes.

> The first obstacle I had to overcome as a young chess player was to avoid being distracted by random, unexpected events- by the mini-earthquakes that afflict all of our days. In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.

> If we can prevent ourselves from being thrown by heightened emotions and instead learn to flow with them, the physiological responses they produce in us can help us defeat obstacles. To harness feelings for a defined purpose, we must first develop an understanding of and tolerance for inner turmoil. We should learn to observe our passions; understand their sources and their unique character. Then we will be able to transform them into creative inspiration for successful action. Once we have an in-depth awareness of our personality and the ways we react to external stimuli, we can use our minds to evoke a powerful internal physiological state at will and channel it to great advantage. – https://theartoflearningproject.org/resources/resilience/the-internal-solution/
