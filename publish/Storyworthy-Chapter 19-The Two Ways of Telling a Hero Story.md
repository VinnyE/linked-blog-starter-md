Telling a story about personal success can be a delicate balancing act, as the natural human tendency is to root for the underdog, not the victor. Thus, the successful storyteller must reframe their triumphs, not as a culmination of brilliance, but as a series of small steps, each fraught with its own challenges and uncertainties. The key is to cast oneself as an underdog who has managed to pull off an unexpected victory against the odds. This approach involves two main strategies: undermining oneself and marginalizing the accomplishment. By focusing on the small steps that led to the success and crediting others for their part in the achievement, the storyteller can make their journey feel more relatable. Moreover, if the story can be tied to a deeper personal transformation brought about by the accomplishment, it will resonate more powerfully with the audience. After all, everyone has their own metaphorical "Mount Everest" to climb; the story of someone who has climbed the literal one can inspire if it reveals universal truths about determination, resilience, and growth.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Appeal of the Underdog
Human beings are naturally drawn to underdog stories. We anticipate their defeat but hope for their victory. Thus, if a storyteller can cast themselves as the underdog in their narrative, the audience will be more invested in their journey and will derive greater satisfaction from their eventual success.

### Marginalizing the Accomplishment
Great accomplishments can often feel distant and unrelatable. To counter this, the storyteller should minimize the focus on the end result and instead highlight the small steps, struggles, and uncertainties that paved the way to success. This makes the narrative more relatable and engaging.

### Crediting Others
Sharing the credit for one's success with others can make a story of achievement more palatable. It not only demonstrates humility but also paints a more realistic picture of how most significant accomplishments come about – through teamwork and collective effort.

### Personal Transformation
The most compelling stories are those that involve personal transformation. If the storyteller can show how their accomplishment led to a profound shift in their perspective, beliefs, or understanding of themselves, the story will resonate more deeply with the audience. It's not just about what was achieved, but how the achievement changed the person.

Underdogs are supposed to lose, so when they manage to pull out an unexpected or unbelievable victory, our sense of joy is more intense than if that same underdog suffers a crushing defeat. A crushing defeat is expected. An unbelievable win is a surprise. You already know the importance of surprise in storytelling. If you cast yourself as the underdog, your audience will enjoy your success. They will root for you. They will expect you to lose and hope for you to win.

> Second, human beings prefer stories of small steps over large leaps. Most accomplishments, both great and small, are not composed of singular moments but are the culmination of many small steps. Overnight success stories are rare. They can also be disheartening to those who dream of similar success. The step-by-step nature of accomplishment is what people understand best.

> This is how to tell a success story: Rather than telling a story of your full and complete accomplishment, tell the story of a small part of the success. Tell about a small step. Feel free to allude to the better days that may lie ahead, but don’t try to tell everything. Small steps only.

> In the summer of 2017 I worked with a man named Tim Warren who summited Mount Everest years before. Is Tim expected to stop his story halfway to the top of the tallest mountain in the world? No. That would be ridiculous. But Tim also failed to reach the summit on his first attempt, and he certainly didn't reach the top on his own. He was part of a climbing team. By passing on some of the credit to the teammates who made his climb possible, and by highlighting his initial failure, Tim can tell the story of his ascent in a way that an audience can relate and connect to. I also suggested this: Can Tim's story be about something other than Mount Everest? If the successful climb taught Tim to trust others, listen to his gut, accept failure, find inner peace, believe in himself, or uncover a strength he never knew he possessed, that would make for a story with much greater universal appeal and potential connectivity. We all have our own Mount Everests to summit. Tim’s just happened to be the real thing. If he can use that enormous pile of rock and ice to reach his audience on their own level by expressing something more personal about his feat, the power of the story and its potential to connect to an audience increases exponentially. Summiting Mount Everest is an adventure story. Changing your life by summiting Mount Everest is a great story.
