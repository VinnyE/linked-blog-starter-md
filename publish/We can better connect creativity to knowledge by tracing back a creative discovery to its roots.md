### Connecting Creativity to Knowledge
Deep, immersive learning leads to moments of insight and discovery. A critical aspect of the creative process involves tracing back these creative discoveries to their roots in the existing knowledge. This involves breaking down the discovery into its technical components and understanding what makes it workâ€”essentially figuring out the "magic" behind the insight. By dissecting these moments and understanding the mechanics behind them, we can expand our knowledge further and refine our approach to learning.
