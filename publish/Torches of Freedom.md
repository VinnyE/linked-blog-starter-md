Torches of Freedom is a master class by [[Edward Bernays]] in applying the principle of [[Inversion]] to great success. 

Rather than focusing on direct marketing strategies to increase cigarette sales, Bernays reimagined a societal landscape in which women freely and frequently smoked. With this vision, he launched a multifaceted campaign that extended beyond simple advertisement, aiming to make cigarettes an integral part of an American woman's daily life. His initiatives ranged from linking smoking to women's emancipation and branding cigarettes as "torches of freedom," to altering the physical environment by encouraging architects and designers to include special compartments for cigarettes in their kitchen designs. This indirect approach ultimately transformed public perceptions of smoking and redefined societal norms.

> Bernays’s efforts to make smoking in public socially acceptable had equally startling results. He linked cigarette smoking with women’s emancipation. To smoke was to be free. Cigarettes were marketed as “torches of freedom.” He orchestrated public events, including an infamous parade on Easter Sunday in 1929 which featured women smoking as they walked in the parade. He left no detail unattended, so public perception of smoking was changed almost overnight. He both normalized it and made it desirable in one swoop.
