Pursuing wisdom and virtue is akin to walking a path less traveled. It is not as obvious or brightly lit as paths promising immediate rewards. However, it is this challenging path, often ignored, that leads to true [[Flourishing]]. It is in striving to keep these values front and center, to be both loved and lovely, according to [[Adam Smith's Theory of Being Loved and Lovely]], that we achieve a sense of contentment and a fulfilling life.
