Stories are life's unique currency, filling gaps in our memories while expanding the borders of our experiences. They add depth and meaning to our existence, transforming seemingly insignificant moments into crucial fragments of our life's narrative. The exercise "First Last Best Worst" is a useful tool to unearth these stories. By documenting and analyzing your first, last, best, and worst experiences for different prompts, you bring forth forgotten memories and illuminate your life in a new, more engaging light.

## Concept Breakdown

### The Value of Stories
Stories act as the currency of life, providing us with depth and a profound understanding of our existence. They act as bridges, connecting disparate memories and filling in gaps in our mental map. The act of rediscovering forgotten moments or recognizing previously ignored experiences as meaningful can expand our understanding of our lives and bring an enriched sense of purpose and direction.

### Story Identification
Recognizing and remembering key moments in life, whether big or small, is a critical part of creating meaningful narratives. Moments previously thought as inconsequential or mundane can take on a new significance when seen as a part of a broader life story. By actively seeking and identifying such moments, you can understand your life under a new, captivating perspective.

### First Last Best Worst Exercise
The "First Last Best Worst" exercise is a creative method for identifying potential stories from our lives. This exercise involves documenting your first, last, best, and worst experiences relating to various prompts such as 'kiss', 'car', 'pet', etc. Each of these entries can potentially be a forgotten memory or a hidden story waiting to be told.

### Analyzing the First Last Best Worst Entries
Once the "First Last Best Worst" chart is completed, the entries are analyzed to identify recurring moments (potential stories) and entries that could be developed into useful anecdotes or fully realized stories. These entries are marked accordingly, providing a visual representation of potential narratives.

### Social and Recreational Use of the Exercise
The "First Last Best Worst" exercise is not only an effective tool for story mining but can also serve as a fun and engaging game. It can be utilized in social settings like long car rides, first dates, or any moments of potential awkwardness and silence. It offers a means of getting to know others better by prompting conversations about diverse life experiences.

> Not only are stories the currency I need to continue entertaining audiences, but more importantly, finding new stories both fills in and fills out my life. They bring breadth and meaning to my life. Recalling a forgotten moment from your life or suddenly seeing it as more than what you once thought can expand the boundaries of your perceived life, while filling in gaps and connecting disparate memories into a more complete picture. Stories will both fill in the holes in the mental map of your life and help you to see how expansive that map truly is. It’s priceless.

> Finding stories from your life can fill in the forgotten moments of your life while expanding our previously perceived boundaries. Moments that once lacked meaning and relevance can suddenly be recognized as critical and essential to your life story. Make it your mission to find, see, remember, and identify stories, and you will begin to see your life in a new and more compelling light. 

> The last story-finding exercise – and one that's ideal for this filling-in and filling-out process – is adapted from an idea given to me by The Moth's artistic director, Catherine Burns. She shared this method of generating story ideas as we watched our children play in the museum one day, and I've since turned her idea into a workshop exercise that I use quite often. It's called First Last Best Worst. All you need to play is a pen and paper.

> As you can see from the worksheet that follows, the top row of the page (the x-axis) is labeled with the words “First,” “Last,” “Best,” and “Worst,” along with a column labeled “Prompts.” Along the left side of the page (the y-axis), the prompts are listed (kiss, car, pet, trouble, injury, gift, travel). The prompts are the possible triggers for memories. What was your first kiss? What was your last kiss? What was your best kiss? What was your worst kiss? For each of these prompts, you fill in the word or words that indicate the answers to those questions. That’s it. 

> After completing my chart, I analyze it. Specifically, I ask myself three questions: 
> 1.​ Do any entries appear more than once (the signal of a likely story)? 2. ​Could I turn any of these entries into useful anecdotes?  3. Could I turn any of these entries into fully realized stories? 
> 
> I mark potential stories (or stories that I have already told) with an S. I mark potential anecdotes with an A.

> First Last Best Worst is also an excellent game for long car rides, first dates, or other moments of potential awkwardness and silence, or simply as a means of getting to know a person better.
