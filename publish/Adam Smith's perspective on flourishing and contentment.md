Adam Smith, the economist and moral philosopher, suggested that flourishing and the contentment it brings is more complex than it appears. He proposed that humans naturally desire to be loved and to be lovely, meaning they seek to be appreciated, admired, and respected, and to be worthy of such admiration and respect. This aligns closely with the concept of flourishing.

Smith identified two paths to earning respect and admiration: being rich, powerful, and famous, or being wise and virtuous. The former path is more visible and alluring, but the latter, though less illuminated, is more fulfilling. This suggests that the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, though less glamorous, can lead to a deeper sense of satisfaction and flourishing.

The pursuit of flourishing requires us to keep this concept at the forefront of our decision-making. It involves going beyond narrow utilitarian considerations and embracing the deeper aspects of identity, purpose, and meaning in our lives.

*More context below:*

[[When faced with a decision, we should consider not just the immediate utility of our choices, but also how we may flourish]]. For instance, choosing to accept a job offer might not make sense from a purely utilitarian perspective, but it might align perfectly with one's sense of self and purpose, making it the right choice. This highlights the importance of flourishing, a state of thriving that goes beyond transient pleasures and discomforts, in guiding our decisions.

Life-altering decisions such as the ones portrayed in [[Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making]], or choosing where to live, are not merely about the immediate benefits or drawbacks. They fundamentally alter our identities and the way we experience life ([[Navigating wild problems shapes personal identity and growth and surfaces the inherent limits of rational decision-making]]). For instance, becoming a spouse or a parent transcends and elevates daily experiences, bringing a deeper sense of meaning and purpose. Something we're not often able to understand the full scope of ahead of time due to [[The Vampire Problem]].

Similarly, the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom was not just about the financial implications. For many voters, the decision was deeply tied to their identities, whether they saw themselves primarily as British or European. This underscores the importance of identity and the sense of belonging in shaping our choices and actions.

Friendship, too, is not merely a transactional relationship that yields returns for time invested. It is an integral part of our being, shaping our identities and enriching our lives. We devote time to our friends not just for the immediate pleasure it brings, but because it is a reflection of who we are.

Voting is another example where identity plays a crucial role. People vote not just to influence the outcome, but because it aligns with their identity as responsible citizens. This sense of duty and responsibility transcends narrow utilitarian considerations.

> So the narrow utilitarian part of the decision wasn’t irrelevant. But the flourishing part of the decision was the decisive one. I took the job because I felt like it was something I was meant to do, a calling. To turn down the opportunity would have felt like a betrayal of the deepest parts of me.

> Having children isn’t just about the daily ups and downs: the pleasure of the double to right-center my kid hits in the high school baseball game or the despair of my child being rejected from the college of their choice. Wearing a robot baby tells you something about the costs of being a parent. It tells you nothing about how your sense of self changes if you have a child and how that in turn affects how you experience life. It doesn’t capture how being a parent can give your life meaning.

> Where we choose to live is about more than which place has better weather, better job opportunities, better options for day trips, better local food, and so on. Where we live is about who we are and not just what we experience.

> When the people of the United Kingdom voted on Brexit–whether to leave the European Union or stay–some focused on the financial consequences of the decision: leaving would make the British people poorer; staying was forcing the United Kingdom to subsidize the rest of the European Union. But for many who voted "leave" and for many who voted "stay", the issue that matters most wasn't the question of the narrow utilitarian issues revolving around their standard of living. For many, the real issue of Brexit was identity. Did the voters see themselves primarily as British or primarily as European? Particularly in England, many who voted to leave felt that their political leaders had given insufficient attention to England as their home and insufficient attention to being English as a source of meaning in their lives. Those who wanted to stay part of the European Union embraced a more cosmopolitan, international identity. 

> We often use transactional words to describe friendship—should I invest in my relationship with so-and-so—as if a friendship were an asset that might yield sufficient return for the time spent. But an alternative is to value friendship independently of how rewarding it is, as an essential part of your being. You might desire to be a good friend even when it isn’t worth it, another financial phrase that implies a utilitarian perspective. For many of us, friendship and the web of connections we establish with our friends establishes who we are. We devote time to our friends independently of how pleasant or unpleasant the experience is from day to day. 

> People vote because they think it’s the right thing to do—it is part of their identity as a citizen. They vote because they don’t want to see themselves as shirkers. They want to see themselves as responsible citizens who have an obligation to vote and who believe in fulfilling their obligation. They don’t see themselves as suckers for voting. They see themselves as admirable. Only an economist seduced by narrow utilitarian considerations would call that irrational. 

> The economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith thought that flourishing, and the contentment it produces, is trickier than it looks. In his little-known masterpiece The Theory of Moral Sentiments, he wrote that “man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely.” By “loved,” he meant not just cared about but praised, appreciated, admired, and respected. We want to matter. And by “lovely,” Smith meant worthy of praise, appreciation, admiration, and respect. And writing in 1759, when he said “man,” he meant human beings. Smith’s idea of being loved and lovely is very close to what I am calling flourishing here

> The path of wisdom and virtue will also earn the respect of those around you, but that path is not so well illuminated. It attracts the attentions of what Smith describes as a "small party," mainly those who themselves are wise and virtuous. The glittering, brighter path is the seductive one. The better path is in the shadows and harder to remember. 

> If you care about flourishing, you have to work hard to keep it front and center.
