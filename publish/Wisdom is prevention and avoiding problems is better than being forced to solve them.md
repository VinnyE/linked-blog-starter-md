[[Charlie Munger]] and [[Warren Buffett]] emphasize that mistakes are inevitable and a natural part of decision-making. They believe success comes from structuring life and business to withstand these errors. They advocate for a "remember your helmet" approach, focusing on simplicity and preparedness. But Munger also highlights the importance of prevention as wisdom. In the end, [[Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance]]. But since mistakes are inevitable, [[We should aim for antifragility, which allows us to adapt, improve, and thrive in the face of adversity]]

“I don’t want to be a great problem solver. I want to avoid problems — prevent them from happening and doing it right from the beginning" ― [[Peter Bevelin]]

Founder's Podcast: #286 Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Speaking Directly to You

> So you have Munger that says that Buffett says, everyone makes mistakes. I've made a lot and I'm going to make more. That's the nature of making a lot of decisions. Try to live your life totally free of mistakes is a life of inaction. Stupidity is inevitable. It happens to everyone. Wrong decisions are part of life being able to make them work out. Anyway, is one of the abilities of those who are successful. And so that's one main theme that they repeat over and over again is the fact that since mistakes are inevitable, you have to structure your life and your business to be able to survive the inevitable bad decisions that you're going to make. And Buffett has a funny little memorable way to describe their approach to being able to survive mistakes. He says, the sign above the player's entrance to the field and Notre Dame reads, play like a champion today. I sometimes joke that the sign at the field in Nebraska reads, remember your helmet. Charlie and I are remember your helmet kind of guys. We like to keep it simple. And then they go into the fact that avoiding problems is better than being forced to solve them. This is a really amazing way that Charlie Munger describes this idea. He says wisdom is prevention. Then Buffett says it wasn't raining when Noah built the arc and he didn't even look that smart for 39 days.
