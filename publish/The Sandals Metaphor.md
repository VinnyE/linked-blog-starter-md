title: "The Sandals Metaphor"

> A man wants to walk across the land, but the earth is covered with thorns. He has two options—one is to pave his road, to tame all of nature into compliance. The other is to make sandals. Making sandals is the internal solution. Like the Soft Zone, it does not base success on a submissive world or overpowering force, but on intelligent preparation and cultivated resilience. – Josh Waitzkin in The Art of Learning

This Indian parable represents the idea of inner solutions over external control. When faced with a world full of thorns (i.e., challenges or disruptions), it's more practical to make sandals (develop personal resilience and adaptability) than to try and pave the entire world (control or eliminate all challenges).
