Decision-making is traditionally perceived as a rational process where you weigh the costs and benefits of your choices (see: [[Darwin's dilemma and the illusion of rationality in wild problem decision-making]]). But, surprisingly, emotions and personal preferences can sometimes guide us more accurately to what we truly desire. In other words, the decision-making process should account for both our rational evaluations and our emotional inclinations. This dual-faceted approach allows us to better discern our preferences, especially when logical analysis alone fails to provide a clear answer.

When it comes to evaluating life's course, it's more effective to consider separately the concept of [[Flourishing]] and [[Narrow utilitarianism]] (merely calculating costs and benefits). Both have their unique pull on how we want to live.
