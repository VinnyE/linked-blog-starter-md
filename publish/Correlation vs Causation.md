Correlation vs Causation is another sort of mental model we can use (see: [[What are mental models]]). It is closely related to [[Probabalistic thinking]].

Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, meaning that they tend to vary together. However, correlation does not imply causation, which is a cause-and-effect relationship where a change in one variable leads to a change in another. It's crucial to differentiate between the two because observing two events occurring simultaneously (correlation) can lead to the erroneous assumption that one event causes the other (causation). This misconception can significantly influence our decision-making process.

This misunderstanding is particularly prominent when observing [[Regression to the mean]], where exceptional results gravitate towards the average over time.

>  Whenever correlation is imperfect, extremes will soften over time. The best will always appear to get worse and the worst will appear to get better, regardless of any additional action. This is called regression to the mean, and it means we have to be extra careful when diagnosing causation. This is something that the general media and sometimes even trained scientists fail to recognize.

>  We notice two things happening at the same time (correlation) and mistakenly conclude that one causes the other (causation). We then often act upon that erroneous conclusion, making decisions that can have immense influence across our lives
