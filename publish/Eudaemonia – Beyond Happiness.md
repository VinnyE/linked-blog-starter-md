Humans care about more than transient joy or avoidance of pain. We desire purpose, meaning, and a sense of belonging. The ancient Greeks referred to this state as 'eudaemonia,' often inadequately translated as happiness or contentment. A better understanding is [[Flourishing]]. In this context, to flourish means to make the most of our circumstances and fulfill our human potential, thus leading a life that is more than just pleasant, but truly well-lived.
