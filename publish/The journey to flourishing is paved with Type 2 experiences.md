title: "The journey to flourishing is paved with Type 2 experiences"

Life isn't merely a series of fleeting pleasures and pains—it encompasses a deeper narrative, an overarching essence, that we call flourishing. This isn't about weighing the transient happiness of a hedonist against the introspective discontent of a philosopher, as Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert suggests. Instead, it's about the complex fusion of these experiences. Our essence, defining us through purpose, meaning, and dignity, remains constant, irrespective of daily fluctuations in feelings. We desire not just momentary pleasures, but lasting fulfillment from purpose and ethical conduct. The order and timing of these experiences matter—contentment following hardship isn't equivalent to an extended pleasure followed by regret. This perspective introduces the idea of Type 1 and Type 2 experiences—Type 1 being pleasant throughout, and Type 2 being challenging but ultimately rewarding and transformative. This understanding of life's fabric—valuing long-term growth and self-improvement over ephemeral pleasure—is likened to the teacher's parable, emphasizing the enriching nature of adversity. Thus, when charting life's course, consider the interplay of fleeting pleasures, persistent hardships, and the greater narrative of personal growth and meaning.

>  Why is it so hard to weigh considerations of flourishing with the day-to-day pleasures and pains that come along with our choices when we face a wild problem?
>  
>  Flourishing is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from our day-to-day pleasures and pains. Quantitatively different because purpose, meaning, dignity, and our sense of self are more important to our overall well-being than enjoying a good meal or getting a flat tire—pleasures and pains whose impacts are relatively small. But the other key difference is that the pleasure of the good meal and the pain from the flat tire are both fleeting. They come, they go. The parts of our well-being related to flourishing persist and overlay our daily experiences. 

> Our essence is not easily compared to our day-to-day feelings of pleasure and pain. That’s because who I am in my essence lies above and beyond whatever I feel today and tomorrow. Purpose, meaning, dignity, being a spouse or parent—these aspects of our lives aren’t just pleasant or unpleasant. They define us and suffuse all of our days, not just this one or that one.

> John Stuart Mill said, “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.” That’s another way of saying that who you are and how you live are more important than what you experience.

>  Dan Gilbert, the Harvard psychologist, disagrees. Gilbert argues that each perspective is self-contained. When you’re the pig, swimming in the pool or enjoying a delicious meal or an exhilarating sexual encounter, you aren’t thinking about the meaning of your life or your identity, your philosopher side. You’re happy, oblivious to whether your life has meaning, for example, or whether swimming in the pool is ethical or consistent with your values. In that one hour of the day when your inner Mill haunts you, sure, you’re uncomfortable with the nature of your life. But in those moments, because you’re wearing your philosopher hat, you’ve lost touch with your inner pig and fail to correctly take into account the pleasure from the choices you’ve made in the other twenty-three hours.
>  
>  Gilbert’s conclusion is that because each perspective ignores the other—something akin to the vampire problem—each type of experience should get equal weight. Gilbert argues that whichever experience has the longest duration—the satisfaction of the pig or the dissatisfaction of the philosopher—should carry the day. All that matters is how long the satisfactions of the pig or the dissatisfactions of the philosopher last. If your time as a pig is longer than any anguish you might feel as the philosopher, you have a good life.

> Most of us, other than maybe Hugh Hefner or Socrates, are a mixture of the shameless hedonist and the wondering philosopher. We enjoy the pleasure of life. We general prefer to avoid pain. But most of us want more than just those day-to-day moments of contentment or pleasure. We want purpose and meaning. We want to behave ethically. We care about our connections to our friends and family. We have a sense of how we should behave with those close to us. And we’re willing to endure some pain to have purpose and meaning and to do the right thing. Who we are, how we see ourselves, and the paths we choose to follow are central to our most important choices. Mill is saying that’s how a human being should live. 

> Most of us don't want to swim in the pool for twenty-three hours no matter how pleasurable it may be in the moment. The hour of self-reflection that follows creates more than an hour of disappointment. 

> A fulfilling life, a life well lived, is about more than adding up pleasure and pain and trying to make the former greater than the latter.

> A life of fifty years of pure pleasure followed by twenty years of regret and shame is not the same as twenty years of suffering followed by fifty years of contentment. The fact that timing matters – whether the good times come before or after – suggest that the good life is about more than toting up costs and benefits and seeing which outweighs the other. We would gladly endure some suffering to achieve something we value deeply even if the suffering lasts longer than the joy that comes from our achievement. 

> Adding up the costs and benefits is the wrong way to think about how to live. Flourishing is something subtler that overarches our day-to-day pleasures and pains. The part of existence I am calling flourishing both transcends and elevates our day-to-day experience. 

> A Type 1 experience is nice the whole time—nothing too stressful, mostly positive. You enjoy it while you’re in the middle of it and you enjoy it after. A day at the beach. A walk in the park. A Type 2 experience is hard. There are moments of pain that have to be endured—difficult days with a lot of altitude gained over a fairly short distance, streams to be crossed without your shoes where the water runs so cold your feet go numb while you’re crossing, heavy gear to be carried on the trek that hurts your back or feet. But a Type 2 experience is one that you never forget, one that makes you stronger, and when you overcome the obstacles in the way, you feel like you’ve accomplished something. A Type 2 experience can teach you something about yourself. A Type 2 experience has a chance to be more than pleasant. It can be exhilarating. You might not enjoy it (much) while you’re in the middle of it. But you enjoy it after it’s over and in a different way than a Type 1 experience.

> There is a parable of the teacher who gives a student a challenge: Here is a stone. Here is a tower with one hundred stairs to the top. Your job is to bring the stone to the top of the tower. Cradling the heavy stone, the student manages to get it to the door of the tower. But the door is very narrow and the stone is too wide. No matter how the student turns the stone, it cannot fit through the door. The task you have given me is impossible, cries the student. The teacher takes a hammer and cracks the stone open so that the pieces all fit easily through the door. The stone is your heart, says the teacher. Only a broken heart can rise upward. As we get older, we understand that the pain we have endured, especially heartbreak, hasn’t just made us stronger. It has made everything we experience richer and fuller. As we get older, we come to prefer bittersweet chocolate to chocolate that is merely sweet.

> In a list of costs and benefits, rather than mixing flourishing alongside what I'm calling narrow utilitarianism, it's more effective to think of each separately and to consider their relative pull in how you want to live.
