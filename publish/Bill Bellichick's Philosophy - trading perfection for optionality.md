Navigating uncertainty is a challenge intrinsic to the human experience. Often, the impulse is to eliminate ambiguity through more information or elaborate strategies. However, this might prove to be an illusionary pursuit. Instead, it is more advantageous to adapt to uncertainty, utilizing it as a tool for decision-making, much like the strategies employed by Bill Belichick, the celebrated head coach of the New England Patriots in the NFL.

Belichick is recognized for his unique approach to the NFL Draft. Despite the extensive data and footage available on potential players, Belichick acknowledges the unreliability of these resources as predictors of future success. Therefore, instead of obsessing over drafting the perfect player, he aims for quantity over quality. Belichick often trades higher picks for multiple later picks, thereby increasing his options. The true potential of the player, in terms of skills and personality, only becomes clear during the training and preseason. The players who don't fit in are cut. This perspective allows Belichick to comfortably make selections with less concern for the uncertainty of their future success.

This strategy, coupled with a flexible approach to sunk costs and a relentless focus on optionality, allows Belichick to create a competitive team. The key is to experiment and take calculated risks, not getting overly attached to specific choices or outcomes, and to optimize for the ability to change one's mind or strategy when necessary.

This mindset is not exclusive to sports and can be applied to many areas of life. A key element of this philosophy is optionality - the freedom to choose but not the obligation. For example, with Zappos' free shipping and return policy, the focus isn't on selecting the perfect shoe in the first purchase but to experiment with different styles, knowing they can be returned. Similarly, this principle operates in venture capital, where success might emerge from a minority of investments.

In essence, embracing uncertainty involves focusing less on making the 'perfect' choice and more on expanding the options available and managing disappointment if things do not go as planned. Whether choosing a career path or making life choices, it is important to remember that 'mistakes' are only choices that didn't go as expected. Recognizing this can alleviate the pressure of regret and transform the challenges of decision-making into exciting adventures. A valuable perspective to adopt is understanding that complete information is unattainable. Therefore, it is essential to take risks, be open to change, and recognize when to cut losses and move forward. It's less about avoiding mistakes and more about creating a life rich with experiences and the potential for unexpected success.

> One reason wild problems are so unpleasant is that the future is shrouded from us. Because we crave control and certainty, our natural impulse is to try to illuminate the darkness with more information and better strategies for coping with wild problems. This is a fool’s game, an illusion. You’re better off trying to get used to the darkness.

> Every year at the NFL Draft, teams pick college players in reverse order to how the teams finished in the previous season. Belichick and his staff, like with every NFL team, spend hundreds of hour preparing. Teams have extensive data on hundreds of players. They conduct personal interviews with doezen of their top prospects. They watch hundreds if not thousands of hours of film that show the players' college performances. The patriots, like all NFL teams, use this mix of qualitative and quantitative information to grade prospects, rank them, and make their draft picks accordingly. This system is so complicated and important to the future of the team that any video footage of the Patriots' war rooms blurs out the whiteboards in the background so competitors get no clue about the system the Patriots use to make their choices. 
> 
> But here's the funny thing. The Patriots don’t really believe in their system as a reliable predictor. They know that their knowledge about the future viability of current college players is loose, vague, and indeterminate. We know that because Belichick is famous for his eagerness to trade a draft pick from an earlier round for multiple draft picks in later rounds. He seems to value quantity over quality. He rarely gives up multiple picks to move up in the draft to choose a particular player—he knows that no matter how many signs point to a player being successful in the NFL, an enormous amount of uncertainty surrounds any one individual.
> 
> So what Belichick does is worry less about getting the exact right player with any one pick. Instead, he tries to choose lots of players. That would seem impossible—each team gets the same number of draft picks. But the Patriots often have more picks than other teams because of Bill’s willingness to trade a high draft pick for more than one pick in a later round. Once the players he chooses arrive at training camp, Belichick gets a lot more information, and in particular, information that he can’t glean from film or talking to college coaches or data gathered at the NFL Scouting Combine, the arduous set of speed, agility, strength, and intelligence tests.

**Four lessons from Bill that extend beyond sports:**
> 1. Optionality is powerful.
	 Optionality is when you have the freedom to do something but not the obligation. Think of Zappos. Zappos is the shoe website with free shipping and free returns. We all understand the pleasantness of not having to pay for shipping or returns. It’s not exactly free—it means the prices are probably going to be a little bit higher than they might otherwise be. In return (sorry!), you get optionality, the ability to change your mind once you’ve seen the shoes up close and worn them around the house.
	 Optionality doesn't just mean a lower cost from a mistake because you don't have to pay for shipping. It should change your whole process of shopping. Buy more shoes. Don't agonize over whether they're the right choice. Don't waste time trying to get more information about whether the reviewers who liked the shoes are like you.
	 The essence of optionality is appreciating that you can’t know in advance what will work. It’s the same idea behind venture capital. Even the best venture capitalists strike out seven times out of ten. One time out of ten they might hit what’s called a unicorn—a company that turns out to have a valuation of a billion dollars or more.
	 Use this idea for living. Try to have more experiences than fewer. Try stuff. Stop doing the stuff that isn’t for you. Embrace the opportunities that make your heart sing. Spend less time trying to figure out in advance what those might be and more time taking chances as long as you can opt out at a low enough cost. Exploring can turn out much better than a planned itinerary.

> 2. Don’t assume that what works for them works for you. When you can, put the shoes on. Test-drive the car

> 3. Sunk costs are sunk.
	 Life choices that turn out differently from what we hoped aren’t mistakes. They’re just choices that turned out differently than we hoped. We shouldn’t call those mistakes. You shouldn’t beat yourself up over them. Forgive yourself. Wild problems that don’t turn out well aren’t mistakes. They’re more like adventures. Adventures have twists and turns and ups and downs. Belichick teaches us that if you can go on an adventure that you can end without great cost, go. If it turns out badly, cut it short. If it turns out well, enjoy the ride. This beats trying to figure out in advance with any precision which adventures are the best ones.
	 
> 4. Grit and persistence are overrated.
	 - Yes, it’s a bad idea to quit immediately just because something is difficult or a little unpleasant. Yes, some tastes are acquired tastes, but some things never become delightful. If you hated law school and hate being a lawyer, try a different kind of law. If that doesn’t help, there’s no shame in changing careers. If you hate law and leave it behind, don’t say you made a mistake. How can it be a mistake when your information was so incomplete? When life turns out to be different than you thought it would be, or you turn out differently than you thought you’d like to be, change. 
	- Not all decisions are vampire problems. If you don't like being a vampire, take off the cape and enjoy the sunshine. Cut your losses and move on.
	   A lot of what makes wild problems so painful is the specter of regret. The potential for these decisions to turn out badly tends to cause fear of making any decision at all. We say to ourselves we need to gather information, ignoring that more information isn't going to help–it's just a form of procrastination. 
	 - Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said, “The only way to understand marriage is to get married. The only way to understand whether a certain career path is right for you is to actually try it for an extended period. Those who hover on the edge of a commitment, reluctant to make a decision until all the facts are in, will eventually find that life has passed them by. The only way to understand a way of life is to take the risk of living it.” All the facts are never in.
	 - One way to avoid letting life pass you by is to stop worrying about making a “mistake.” It’s not a mistake when you can’t do any better. So spend less time on figuring out the “right” decision and more time on thinking about how to widen your options and how to cope with disappointment if the decision turns out badly.
