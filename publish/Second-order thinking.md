First-order thinking involves anticipating the immediate results of our actions, which is relatively simple and safe but often yields similar outcomes to those of others. In contrast, second-order thinking, another sort of mental models (see: [[What are mental models]]), involves considering both the immediate consequences of our actions and their subsequent effects. Doing so allows us to think more holistically and plan further ahead (see: [[Enhance decision-making by overcoming obstacles to learning from reality]]). 

By incorporating second-order thinking, we can prioritize long-term interests and avoid pitfalls, as illustrated by Warren Buffet's parade metaphor:

> Warren Buffett used a very apt metaphor once to describe how the second-order problem is best described by a crowd at a parade: Once a few people decide to stand on their tip-toes, everyone has to stand on their tip-toes. No one can see any better, but they’re all worse off

> Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions. This type of first-order thinking is easy and safe but it’s also a way to ensure you get the same results that everyone else gets. Second-order thinking is thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well. Failing to consider the second- and third-order effects can unleash disaster.
